API Response
Exchange rates delivered by the Metals-API API are by default relative to USD. All data is returned in standard JSON format and can be parsed easily using any programming language.

When fetching metal rates with USD selected as the base currency (utilizing the 'base' parameter, defaulting to USD if not specified), it is necessary to apply 1/value to the API response.

For instance, to ascertain the gold rate in USD from the API response value, execute 1/0.0004831705, yielding 2069.6627795 USD.

Furthermore, when USD serves as the base, the API response will include the USD Price without requiring additional conversion. This can be identified, for example, as USDXAU. (ONLY APPLIES FOR LATEST ENDPOINT).

Additionally, it's important to note that if you opt for a different base currency, such as EUR, the 1/value division is not necessary. The price is already converted.

        [...]
    }
}      
As illustrated above, the API's response - when queried for real-time exchange rates - always contains a timestamp object containing a standard UNIX time stamp indicating the time the given exchange rate data was collected, a base object containing the three-letter currency code or metal code of the base currency, a date object containing the date the given exchange rate data was collected, and a rates object containing the actual exchange rate data.

Further below, in the Endpoints section, the API response structure will be discussed in detail.

JSONP Callbacks
The Metals-API API comes with support for JSONP Callbacks. This feature enables you to specify a function name, pass it into the API's callback GET parameter and cause the API to return your requested API response wrapped inside that function.

Example Call:

https://metals-api.com/api/latest?access_key=auqo8u28fcey8rc3z6b19deko3w8w1f3hh0ls6lf1ka3naf1nqyx334550mb&callback=MY_FUNCTION
Copy
In the example call above we are requesting the API to use the callback name MY_FUNCTION.

Example Response: Your API response will be wrapped inside your preferred callback function.

({
    "success": true,
    "timestamp": 1519296206,
    "base": "EUR",
    "date": "2018-09-10",
    "rates": {
        "AUD": 1.566015,
        "CAD": 1.560132,
        "CHF": 1.154727,
        "CNY": 7.827874,
        "GBP": 0.882047,
        "JPY": 132.360679,

        [...]
    }
})  
Access-Control / CORS
Metals-API also supports Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) and Access-Control Headers. This will enable you to use the Metals-API API via Cross-Origin HTTP Requests.

Learn more about CORS »

HTTP ETags
HTTP ETags are a way of reducing the load on your back-end by requesting new Metals-API data only if rates have changed since the last API response.

What are ETags?

An ETag is a part of the HTTP protocol and one of the several mechanisms used for cache validation. The ETag is an identifier assigned to a data resource in a server, and if that resource is ever updated at the server, the ETag is changed.

Whenever a resource is requested (via its URL), the data and ETag are retrieved and stored in the Web cache, and the ETag is sent along with subsequent requests. If the ETag at the server has not changed, a "Not Modified" message is returned, and the cached data is used. (Definition by pcmag.com)

ETags - Quickstart Guide
Step 1
Your initial request to the Metals-API API will create an ETag object containing a unique ETag key and a Date object containing the exact date and time at which the data was last modified. This data must be cached along with the entire API response in order for ETags to work.

ETag: "202567a75aef2e66a3ebf2366bff048f"  
Date: Mon, 12 Apr 2018 11:30:01 GMT
Step 2
Once you make another API request, make sure to include the If-None-Match HTTP header and set it to your previously generated ETag value. Moreover, you will need to add the If-Modified-Since HTTP header to your API request containing the date and time data from your last request. Additionally, you can include other optional headers for enhanced functionality:

If-None-Match: "1872ade88f3013edeb33decd74a4f947"  
If-Modified-Since: Fri, 10 Apr 2015 12:10:04 GMT
Cache-Control: max-age=3600
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
User-Agent: YourApp/1.0
Step 3
Depending on whether or not your result set has updated since your last API request, the API will return either:

the results from your initial API request along with a 304 – Not Modified HTTP header indicating that no change has occured. In this case, the size of the API response will be as small as 0.2kb;
or new results with an entirely new set of ETag and Date objects indicating that new data has been accessed. In this case, the size of your API response will be normal.
Potential Errors
Whenever a requested resource is not available or an API call fails for another reason, a JSON error is returned. Errors always come with an error code and a description.

Example Error: The following error is returned if your monthly API request volume has been exceeded.

{
    "success": false,
    "error": {
        "code": 429,
        "info": "Your monthly API request volume has been reached. Please upgrade your plan."
    }
}      
Other Errors:

Error Code	Description
400	Bad Request - Invalid parameters or malformed request.
401	Unauthorized - Invalid or missing API key.
403	Forbidden - Account inactive or insufficient permissions.
404	Not Found - The requested resource or endpoint does not exist.

Time-Series Endpoint
The Metals-API timeseries endpoint allows you to query the API for daily historical rates between two dates of your choice. (The date limits per API request depend on the acquired plan).

This endpoint has a limitation depending on the acquired plan, allowing only one symbol per request. If you need to query more than 30 days or more than one symbol, you should send another API call.

For LME symbols, the prices provided in this endpoint correspond to the first known price of the previous day (not the requested day). For example, a request for 2024-11-13 will return the price from 2024-11-12.

For LBMA symbols, there is a two-day delay. For example, a request for 2024-08-22 will return the closing price for the 20th.

For other symbols, the prices correspond to the first known price of the requested day.

You cannot use the current date for the "end_date" parameter. We recommend using a day prior to the current date to get a successful response. To get the latest price, you will need to use the latest endpoint.

We also offer specific historical endpoints for LBMA and LME, where older data is available.

    let base: String
    let date: String
    let rates: [String: Double]
}

func getExchangeRates() async throws -> ExchangeRates {
    let accessKey = "auqo8u28fcey8rc3z6b19deko3w8w1f3hh0ls6lf1ka3naf1nqyx334550mb"
    let base = "USD"
    let symbols = "XAU,XAG"
    
    let urlString = "https://metals-api.com/api/latest?access_key=\(accessKey)&base=\(base)&symbols=\(symbols)"
    guard let url = URL(string: urlString) else {
        throw NSError(domain: "Invalid URL", code: 0)
    }
    
    let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
    let exchangeRates = try JSONDecoder().decode(ExchangeRates.self, from: data)
    
    return exchangeRates
}
