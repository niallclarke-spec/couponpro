You are working on a web app that uses Clerk for authentication.

GOAL:
- Fix the frontend login so Clerk is the ONLY login UI
- Remove duplicate login widgets
- Fix dark mode styling so “Continue with Google” text is readable
- Ensure only a specific admin email can access the admin dashboard
- Keep static password login temporarily but clearly mark it for removal

TASKS (DO THESE IN ORDER):

1) LOGIN PAGE CLEANUP
- Remove or hide any custom HTML login card/UI.
- Leave ONLY a single container for Clerk, e.g. <div id="clerk-root"></div>.
- Ensure Clerk.mountSignIn() is called exactly once.

2) CLERK DARK MODE FIX
- When calling Clerk.mountSignIn, apply Clerk’s dark theme properly:
  - Use baseTheme: Clerk.themes.dark
  - Ensure button text (including Google login) is white and readable
  - Do NOT use manual CSS overrides on Clerk internals

3) REMOVE DOUBLE RENDERING
- Ensure Clerk is not mounted twice due to:
  - duplicate script loads
  - repeated initialization after fetching /api/config
- Add a guard so mountSignIn cannot run more than once.

4) ADMIN EMAIL RESTRICTION
- Treat the email "niallclarkefs@gmail.com" as the ONLY admin.
- After Clerk authentication, read the user’s primary email.
- If the email is NOT "niallclarkefs@gmail.com":
  - Block access to admin.html
  - Show a clear “Access denied” message.
- Enforce this both:
  - frontend (UX)
  - backend (API protection)

5) BACKEND AUTH CHECK
- Ensure backend endpoints validate Clerk JWTs properly.
- /auth/me should return the authenticated Clerk user if logged in.
- Admin-only endpoints must additionally verify the email.

6) LEGACY LOGIN HANDLING
- Leave the static password login working for now.
- Add clear TODO comments in both frontend and backend explaining:
  - it must be removed once Clerk is fully live
  - which files/lines to delete later

7) DO NOT:
- Do not add hacks
- Do not hardcode UI styles inside Clerk components
- Do not introduce new auth systems

OUTPUT:
- Update only the necessary files
- Keep changes minimal and clean
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
