Proceed with Step 10: Organize background workers (scheduler + monitors) into workers/ without changing internal logic.

Scope:
- Create workers/ package and add wrapper modules ONLY:
  - workers/__init__.py
  - workers/scheduler.py
  - workers/price_monitor.py
  - workers/milestone_tracker.py

Rules:
- NO changes to scheduler/monitor internal logic, timing, or behavior.
- Do NOT refactor loops, conditions, or shared state.
- Do NOT introduce new dependencies.
- Keep exactly ONE scheduler start at runtime.
- Maintain Step 7 invariant: importing server must NOT start workers.
- server startup must still call bootstrap.start_app(ctx) (or equivalent) as the only place workers start.

Implementation:
1) In workers/*.py, create thin wrappers that import and call existing implementations.
   Example pattern:
   - workers/scheduler.py exposes start_forex_scheduler() by importing the existing start function and re-exporting it.
   - workers/price_monitor.py re-exports the existing price_monitor singleton or start function.
   - workers/milestone_tracker.py re-exports the existing milestone_tracker singleton or start function.
   Do not move internal code yet—just provide a clean workers namespace.

2) Update ONLY the place where workers are started (bootstrap/start_app) to call through workers/ wrappers.
   No other behavior changes.

After Step 10 STOP and paste:
A) python3 -c "import server; print('server import ok')" (no scheduler/webhooks)
B) python3 server.py (exactly one scheduler start)
C) Confirm scheduler log cadence still appears as before
D) curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/check-auth
E) curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/telegram-webhook
F) curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/stripe/webhook

Then report:
- which wrappers were created
- where bootstrap/server now calls into workers/
- confirmation that no internal worker code was modified
Do not proceed beyond Step 10 without approval.
