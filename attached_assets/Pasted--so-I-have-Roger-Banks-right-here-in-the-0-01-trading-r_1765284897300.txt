so I have Roger Banks right here in the
0:01
trading room and uh he's going to pretty
0:03
much break down in the trade that he
0:04
took we just want to know his thought
0:06
process you know before the trade during
0:08
the trade and also after the trade all
0:09
right uh we're looking at Gold we're
0:11
looking at the uh 15 to 30 minute time
0:13
frame okay you know since this is not a
0:16
li management scenario so we can't
0:18
switch between time frames this is a
0:21
trade I took on the 2nd December a
0:22
little bit after London open we can see
0:24
how the candles are moving bullish bull
0:27
right so as they're moving bullish
0:30
um overall trend was bearish like look
0:33
how we came down so like you know we're
0:36
move moving up so what I was looking for
0:39
at this point is to create some sort of
0:42
a resistance okay so I can take a sell
0:45
to maybe like you know retest 26 25
0:49
which was like you know 40 50 Pips away
0:51
so that's what we were looking at so
0:53
we're just waiting at this point some
0:55
sort of a resistance or some sort of a
0:58
confirmation where we can take yeah so
1:01
now the candle has formed we've created
1:03
some sort of a resistance but if you
1:06
look at the time you look at the time at
1:08
the bottom this says 11:45 yes 11:45
1:12
which is 15 minutes before London op
1:15
London op right this means the 30 minute
1:17
candle still open and the 1 hour candle
1:19
is still open even though the resistance
1:22
is formed on the 15 minute we cannot
1:24
take a sell because we don't know where
1:27
London will move price okay okay so had
1:32
to wait for the 30 minute to close and
1:34
the 1 hour to close so now the 15minute
1:36
candle closed like this which is now the
1:39
30 minute has closed one hour has has
1:42
closed in 30 minutes well now if I'm
1:44
looking at Market structure I know that
1:47
this is a resistance being
1:52
formed right here we have a resistance
1:55
formed and if we can break and close
1:58
above this area then price can
2:01
potentially continue to push up which is
2:05
where we have like a 38 pip range okay
2:08
right or if we can create some sort of a
2:11
selling scenario then probably we can
2:13
push down towards
2:15
2625 which is you know whatever we start
2:19
it's like a 50 55 pip range you know
2:22
because whenever you're looking at a
2:23
chart you need to identify if price will
2:26
move bullish how far can it go if it's
2:29
going to move bearish
2:30
how far can it fall you know so we're
2:32
just waiting at this point now the
2:34
15-minute candle has closed bearish
2:37
right we tried to move up we couldn't
2:39
move up this 15-minute candle you look
2:41
at the wick right the wick tried to go
2:44
above this Zone reject but we couldn't
2:46
go above the zone right now you got to
2:48
look at it this way whenever you have
2:50
sessions in the market that's where
2:52
there's supposed to be volume right so
2:55
we had volume in Pre London right pre-
2:59
London had some volume and now we start
3:01
to consolidate consolidation happens
3:03
when candles print next to each other so
3:06
now I'm looking at this do you know
3:07
about impulse entries yes inov yes okay
3:10
so impulse entries is something we go
3:12
over in a lot of detail in M University
3:15
okay just to explain to people when I'm
3:18
looking at this I'm looking to see that
3:19
okay if the next 15minute candle breaks
3:23
below this low what's the probability
3:27
that it can then continue to push down
3:30
to fill this Wick here to the left hand
3:33
side which is 25 Pips right and if
3:36
there's volume in London open can we
3:39
break below this Wick to continue
3:41
pushing down
3:43
towards you know this 38 pip range right
3:47
so my whole idea was that okay if the
3:49
15in candle next one breaks below this
3:51
low the cell will go in and then we will
3:55
aim for price to fill this Wick or we're
3:57
going to aim for like 13 to 17 18 Pips
4:01
and just close the position since it's a
4:03
Monday one trade just aim for like
4:06
certain amount of Pips so we took the
4:08
cell as we broke below the low can I
4:10
take a cell over here or something yes
4:11
you can just put the yeah okay awesome
4:15
great so hit next bar over here yes see
4:19
price went down that's where I secured
4:21
and then we rejected okay price came
4:23
down I actually on this one I secured
4:27
about 13 13 Pips right over here right
4:32
so when we broke below the low I took
4:34
the cell my stop loss was above the
4:37
current candle because if a candle is
4:41
breaking the low of the previous candle
4:43
then it should not break its own high
4:46
okay right once this candle is breaking
4:49
below the low which means now it's going
4:51
to make a lower low yes if it was going
4:53
to make a lower low it has no business
4:56
breaking its own high if it breaks its
4:58
own high then this means it may not go f
5:02
further down right so that's why the
5:03
stop loss was right over here and not
5:06
all the way right up over here because
5:08
if the stop loss is all the way up over
5:09
here and this candle breaks its own high
5:12
now you're hoping that it doesn't hit
5:15
your stop loss which is like you know
5:16
makes no sense like a it's like a 75 pip
5:19
stop yeah like or I don't know but it
5:23
shouldn't break its own Hut so that's
5:24
why the stop CL right over here impul
5:26
entry went in price came down didn't get
5:29
greedy got about 13 14 15 Pips and
5:33
closed it the trade because you know you
5:36
never know you never know whether this
5:39
candle will reject like this or it will
5:43
continue to push down okay you never
5:44
know you know that's why it's very
5:46
important if you want to let it run
5:49
secure 90% And then let the rest run or
5:53
rather than letting the whole thing run
5:54
I see wow so we are just on a 15 minutes
5:56
time frame which exact time frame did
5:58
you take this entry this one 15 minut 15
6:01
minut 15 minute oh I see yeah yeah yeah
6:03
because like you know sometimes the 30
6:04
minute or the 1 hour they're like good
6:06
confirmations but sometimes you're not
6:09
going to get that opportunity right and
6:11
there are a lot of guys that say okay
6:13
like you know what you got to focus on
6:14
the 30- minute confirmation or the one
6:15
hour confirmation but the problem is bro
6:17
if you're looking at the 30 minute
6:19
confirmation and sometimes price moves
6:22
and you miss it some people get annoyed
6:25
with it right they get frustrated oh I
6:27
missed a trade you know blah blah but if
6:29
you instead of taking another trade
6:31
instead of overtrading if you look at
6:34
Price action and ask yourself that okay
6:36
I missed it on the 30 minute was there
6:38
any confirmation on the 15minute time
6:40
frame and then you're like okay you know
6:42
what maybe I could have taken sell once
6:44
you broke the low and secured around
6:46
this Wick fill and called it a day yeah
6:48
I think that would have been a good idea
6:50
and you then you make a note of it you
6:53
know this happens again you make a not
6:55
again happens again you make and when it
6:57
happens the fourth and the fifth time
6:59
you're going to oh you know what I've
7:01
seen this happens before let me execute
7:03
on it right that is just the power of
7:05
journaling right yeah so up to now do
7:07
you still Journal I still journal in my
7:11
head okay in your head I still journal
7:13
in my head right like like um like you
7:15
just like we were talking uh like they
7:17
asked me what was the trade I took I I
7:19
took one trade on Monday yeah because I
7:20
remember the trade remember you know and
7:23
the exact what it was what happened you
7:25
know so so journaling is still important
7:27
but Journal is something you advise
7:28
people to do right 100% whether you win
7:31
a trade if you win a trade you have to
7:32
journal to see where could you have had
7:35
a better entry right because there's
7:37
always a better entry because if you
7:39
have a better entry that means your
7:41
monetary reward is going to be bigger
7:42
you know if you lost a trade always ask
7:45
yourself that okay how could I have
7:47
lowered my loss if I lost $100 how could
7:51
I have lost $80 you know with risk
7:53
management so that's the most important
7:55
thing that's what you learned from
7:57
journaling this was actually win trade
8:00
let's just say you lost let's just say
8:02
imagine you lost this trade okay me your
8:04
reaction are you going to be emotional
8:05
are you just going to get back and take
8:07
a money back or what yeah okay so what
8:10
happened was after let's say for example
8:13
I was in this trade and my stop loss was
8:17
above this candle right over here right
8:19
and now trade went in profits I thought
8:22
trade going profits and now we retrace
8:25
and now I'm thinking H I'm at break even
8:28
now yeah right you sold money actually
8:31
yeah yeah so should I hope for price to
8:34
go further down or should I look at it
8:37
logically and say okay we've had a
8:39
rejection what's the probability that
8:42
price will go up to hit my stop loss
8:45
versus price is just going to drop down
8:47
here right first things come to your
8:49
mind that okay we've had a rejection it
8:51
may hit my stop loss okay if it's going
8:52
to hit my stop loss what am I going to
8:54
do am I going to close 50% over here
8:59
okay and let the rest on because if I
9:01
close 50% here and if it hits my stop
9:04
loss how much have I lost I've lost 50%
9:08
of what I wanted to lose yes that's
9:10
still a win let's see what happens here
9:13
hit
9:15
play and see stop sauce got hit so I
9:19
lost 50% of what I planned on losing
9:22
okay you know so whenever I lose I make
9:24
sure I lose less than what I'm planning
9:26
on losing because I can still consider
9:28
that as a win okay you know because I
9:30
didn't lose the whole thing I lost
9:32
partial of it and if I lost 50% then I
9:35
can use the remaining 50% in another
9:39
trade that I'm going to take so even if
9:41
I lose the trade the whole thing and I
9:43
was looking for a sell I will never
9:45
change my bias I will keep my bias
9:47
exactly the same I'm going to look for
9:49
the same sell again with a better
9:51
confirmation oh because when you change
9:53
your bias let's say you go in a buy and
9:55
you lose the buy and then price
9:57
eventually goes down then you're GNA say
9:58
man I should have stuck to my bias why
10:01
does this happen to me right right so so
10:04
those like different like you know you
10:06
gotta micromanage our own CES in minin
10:09
very I see so psychology wise you know a
10:11
lot of people cannot even stand to take
10:13
losses yes people say behind the chart
10:17
as with the with the employer sorry
10:19
employee mindset but not the employer
10:21
mindset with the employee mindset not
10:23
not seeing the chart as a business right
10:26
so they getting to you know an employer
10:28
will basically running business hoping
10:30
to make a profit or or lose when this is
10:32
an employer but an employee will just
10:34
show up at work and pretty much expect
10:36
to be paid the fact that he's there like
10:39
they cannot really stand a chance to
10:40
lose to lose money in the market simply
10:42
because they are thinking as employees
10:45
man Traders are worse than employees and
10:47
let me tell you why if you're an
10:49
employee right let's say I'm working in
10:51
this office I'm an employee I'm going to
10:53
go downstairs after I'm done I'm going
10:55
to sit in a car and I'm going to go home
10:58
right what trailers do is they'll go in
11:01
their car they'll sit there and they'll
11:04
watch the building just like when you're
11:06
watching the charts you know your time
11:08
of trading is done it's finished but
11:10
you're still watching the charts for God
11:12
knows what yeah right and then you're
11:13
going to trade so they're better their
11:15
employees they're going to go sit in
11:16
their car and they watch the building a
11:18
let's see who comes out next let's see
11:19
who comes out next right so so so now
11:23
look this whole trade happened in like 2
11:25
minutes and 30 seconds right but in
11:29
17 minutes we knew that the cell is not
11:32
going to work now I'm done after that
11:36
okay like you know I'm done once I know
11:38
that okay my trade's over I'm done after
11:40
that done for the day I'm done for the
11:42
day I'm done for the like look at it
11:44
this way right if you're job is to go
11:46
out there and you can go home after you
11:48
get your first sale you're going to get
11:49
your first sale and you're going to go
11:51
home if the payout is Big you're going
11:53
to go home you're not going to continue
11:55
to do more sales because here's the
11:56
catch if you continue to do more sales
11:59
you may lose that first sip okay right
12:02
that's how I look at it if I'm going to
12:04
win a trade I'm done I'm going to go
12:06
home you know this month I took one
12:08
trade this was the only trade I took I
12:12
called it a day I'm like I'm done you
12:14
know if I lose a trade I'm done for the
12:16
day I don't you don't even want to see
12:18
anything about chart no I hate charts
12:20
after that I hate looking at the charts
12:23
after that you know I'm done it's like
12:25
work yeah why would I want to talk about
12:27
my work after work like you know I come
12:29
here I do what I have to do win or loss
12:31
I learn I come back the next day I don't
12:33
care right yeah thank you so much it's
12:36
very tough bro and this is what you got
12:37
to do after you're done after you're
12:39
done and and people ask me how do you

12:49
cirle you put your stool back you stand
12:52
out and you go out that's all what you
12:55
