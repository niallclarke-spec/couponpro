You are in PLAN mode. Do NOT modify code. Your job is to VERIFY the claimed completed work exists, is wired in, and does not change EntryLab behavior.

Claimed completed work to verify:
1) CGI module removal:
   - server.py no longer imports cgi
   - domains/coupons/handlers.py no longer uses cgi.FieldStorage
   - utils/multipart.py exists and is used by upload endpoints
2) Stripe rebill fixes:
   - no current_period_end KeyError
   - uses safe accessor patterns + Invoice.create_preview fallback
   - has 5-minute caching
3) Multi-tenant setup wizard foundation:
   - core/tenant_credentials.py exists and is used
   - domains/tenant/handlers.py endpoints exist AND are registered
   - api/middleware.py has route guards:
       a) EntryLab-only guard
       b) Forex SaaS guard requiring setup completion for non-entrylab
   - EntryLab continues using environment credentials unchanged
   - Non-entrylab tenants are blocked from Forex features until setup complete

DELIVERABLE:
A verification report with:
- Exact file paths + key functions/classes found
- Exact route registration locations (where endpoints are attached to the app/router)
- Exact middleware insertion point (where middleware runs in request flow)
- A test matrix (requests to run) + expected responses
- Any discrepancies or “claimed but not actually wired” items

CONSTRAINTS:
- Do NOT ask me questions. Make reasonable assumptions and state them.
- Do NOT output secrets/tokens.
- Use concrete evidence: show the relevant lines/blocks (short excerpts) and where they are.

STEPS TO PERFORM (must include outputs):
A) Codebase evidence (commands + results)
   - rg -n "import cgi|cgi\.FieldStorage" .
   - rg -n "parse_multipart|BytesParser|utils/multipart" .
   - rg -n "tenant_credentials|resolve_credentials|tenant_users|tenant_integrations" .
   - rg -n "setup-status|/api/tenant|tenant/integrations" .
   - rg -n "apply_route_checks|tenant_id|entrylab" api/ domains/ core/
   - rg -n "Invoice\.create_preview|current_period_end|rebill|cache" integrations/stripe

B) Route wiring proof
   - Identify the exact server/app factory file(s)
   - Show where tenant handlers are imported and registered
   - Confirm URL paths and HTTP methods

C) Middleware behavior proof
   - Show how tenant_id is derived for:
       1) EntryLab/admin password auth
       2) Clerk user auth (if present)
   - Confirm where tenant context is stored (e.g., flask.g, request.state, etc.)
   - Confirm what happens if tenant cannot be resolved

D) Runtime verification plan (commands I can run)
   Provide curl commands and expected status codes for:
   - GET /api/check-auth (unauth)
   - GET /api/tenant/setup-status (unauth then auth)
   - POST /api/tenant/integrations (auth)
   - GET /api/forex-signals (entrylab auth vs non-entrylab auth)
   - POST /api/upload-template (auth multipart)
   - GET /api/telegram/revenue-metrics (auth)

E) Regression guard: “EntryLab unchanged”
   - Prove resolve_credentials prefers environment for tenant_id='entrylab'
   - Prove tenant integrations cannot override entrylab env-based creds
   - Prove existing routes still accessible for entrylab

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Section 1: Evidence Summary (pass/fail per claim)
- Section 2: Wiring Proof (routes + middleware call path)
- Section 3: Test Matrix (curl tests + expected outputs)
- Section 4: Risks / Gaps (anything that could break in prod)
