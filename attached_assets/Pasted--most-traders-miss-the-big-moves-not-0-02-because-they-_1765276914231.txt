most traders miss the big moves not
0:02
because they're bad traders but because
0:05
they exit too early but what if you had
0:07
a method to catch the trend and hold it
0:10
until the very end in this video I'm
0:12
going to show you exactly how you can
0:14
hold humongous swing trades ride the
0:17
entire trend using hike and ashy candles
0:21
and the best part is this is all going
0:23
to be on gold deepo this video is for
0:26
you he asked "May you please make a
0:27
video on how to capture big trends."
0:29
Love from India love you back let's get
0:31
into it here is something that traders
0:32
do not like to admit no one knows
0:34
exactly when the big trend is going to
0:35
begin not me not institutions not banks
Key Points
0:38
but here's the key points that you need
0:40
to understand you do not need to catch
0:42
the bottom you also won't predict the
0:45
top you just need to stay in once it
0:48
starts ride most of the move and not all
0:51
of it and for that you need higher time
0:53
frames and a way to filter out the noise
0:55
that's where hikenashy candles come in
What You Need
0:57
here's what you need to swing trade like
1:00
a pro first you need a daily time frame
1:03
chart for direction trend structure and
1:06
support and resistance zones then you
1:08
need to be looking at your 1 hour chart
1:10
for entries using hikenashi candles hike
1:13
aashy candles are amazing because they
1:15
smooth out the chart so you can see
1:17
clean trends without getting out of your
1:20
trade early and lastly support and
1:22
resistance this is where you will find
1:23
the most logical breakout zones hyenashi
Hyenashi Candles
1:26
candles meaning average bar in Japanese
1:29
are a type of candlestick chart that
1:31
smooths out price and makes trends
1:33
easier to identify they're calculated by
1:35
averaging the previous periods open high
1:37
low and close and the open of the
1:40
current period is the average of the
1:41
previous periods open and close this
1:44
averaging effects helps reduce the
1:46
market noise and filter out minor price
1:48
fluctuations resulting in a cleaner
1:51
chart that is easier to interpret for
1:53
trend analysis so basically the red
1:55
candles stay red for longer even though
1:57
there's green candles in between and the
1:59
green candles stay green longer even
2:01
though there's some small price movement
Visualization
2:03
in that the larger sized hyenashi
2:06
candles means very strong momentum and
2:09
the smallersized hyenashi candles means
2:12
very weak momentum so putting a
2:14
visualization on this you can have
2:17
multiple large green hyenashi candles
2:20
and then they start getting smaller then
2:23
you see a hike and aashy candle with a
2:25
wick on the top and the bottom followed
2:27
by subsequent downtrend hike and aashy
2:30
candles that get bigger and bigger and
2:32
bigger the first hike and ashy candle in
2:35
the color change is the one that you
2:37
want to be looking at but more
2:38
specifically the one that has no wick on
2:42
the bottom that's going to be a strong
2:44
beginning of the new trend and sometimes
2:47
these trends last a very long time and
2:50
you can have massive swing trades from
2:52
this okay so this is gold on the daily
2:56
time frame what I want you to do and the
2:59
easiest way to mark areas of support and
3:02
resistance on this higher time frame is
3:05
completely ignore these candles and
3:07
change your chart to a line chart then
3:10
you will use your horizontal tool to
3:12
mark up areas of support and resistance
3:15
where price bounced off of it or broke
3:17
through it and then used it as support
3:20
if the price can't get through it it's
3:22
known as resistance and if it bounces on
3:24
top of it it's known as support now once
3:27
you've marked this up on the daily time
3:28
frame you'll be able to see where
3:31
current price is and that it's sitting
3:33
in between a level of resistance and a
3:36
level of support now all you need to do
3:39
is zoom into your chart transition your
3:41
candles to hike aashi candles and you'll
3:44
have a much clearer trend than
3:46
traditional candlesticks show and now
3:49
that we've seen that this price rejected
3:51
this level of resistance twice creating
3:55
a double top and this showing our first
3:59
no wick candle as a trend reversal this
4:02
is our potential entry now what you can
4:05
do is take the chart to the 1 hour time
4:07
frame and if we're looking at the
4:09
current time right here it's 9:00 a.m
4:11
the bullish candles are starting to
4:14
decrease in size and we're getting wicks
4:16
on the top and the bottom zooming in
4:19
closer here you can see wick on the
4:21
bottom wick on the top so what you
4:24
should be waiting for here is a bearish
4:27
hike and ashy candle with no wick on the
4:30
top you can enter in a trade once that
4:33
candle closes and you're simply holding
4:36
the trade as long as you get bearish
4:39
candles you keep holding the trade now
4:42
if the trend stops here at this level of
4:44
support that you had already marked up
4:46
on your higher time frame and the
4:48
candles start turning bullish you know
4:50
that this downtrend is losing momentum
4:53
and price may find support at this zone
4:56
but just to confirm it you should go
4:58
back out to the daily time frame and if
5:00
you see another gigantic no wick bearish
5:03
candle you can hold the trade until the
5:06
next day increasing your chances of
5:08
holding a massive move to the downside
Checklist
5:11
here is your checklist the daily charts
5:14
must show an uptrend the breakouts must
5:16
be above the daily resistance the 1-hour
5:19
hike and aashy candles closes with no
5:21
bottom wick strong body size meaning a
5:24
little bit larger showing momentum and
5:27
that price is not in the middle of a
5:29
consolidation zone and here's a bonus
5:31
tip you can use small pending orders
5:34
just above that no- wick candle high
5:37
that way you don't miss the faster
5:39
breakouts now this is where most people
5:41
mess up you enter in on a clean bullish
5:44
signal and now what the answer's simple
5:46
you do absolutely nothing you patiently
5:49
wait until those hyenashi candles tell
5:52
you that it's time to exit here are your
Exit Rules
5:54
exit rules exit only when an opposite
5:57
color hyenashi candle closes ignore
6:00
small pullbacks as long as the candle
6:03
stays bullish and this one is optional
6:06
you can tighten your stoploss after
6:09
major swings are formed this is
6:11
basically creating a comfortable
6:13
trailing stop-loss you need to let the
6:16
market and the hike and aashy candles
6:17
tell you when the trend is over and not
6:20
listen to your feelings on this one so
Recap
6:21
just to recap this is your stepbystep
6:24
howto guide open your charts on the
6:26
daily time frame mark up your support
6:28
and resistance zoom in to a 1-hour chart
6:31
look for those support and resistance
6:32
zones and bullish candles with no wicks
6:34
on the bottom enter with conviction do
6:37
not hesitate and exit only when the
6:39
hyenashi candle closes in the opposite
6:41
color now here are some bonus tips stick
6:44
to trending pairs like gold like US30
6:48
and probably even GBP JPY try to avoid
6:52
ranging markets if you're looking at an
6:54
asset class that's just trading sideways
6:56
for days weeks and months this is not
6:59
going to work for you and you're going
7:00
to be frustrated and the most important
7:02
bonus tip is use alerts and
7:04
notifications from Trading View to tell
7:06
you when those opposite colored hyenashi
7:09
candles form so you don't have to sit
7:11
there on the charts day in and day out
7:13
you can actually spend your time doing
7:14
your hobbies try this method out and let
7:16
me know how it goes in the comment
7:18
section and if you have a question that
7:20
you want specifically answered in video
7:22
format let me know in the comment
