Add a real Smoke Test Script (scripts/smoke_tenant_isolation.py)

Create scripts/smoke_tenant_isolation.py that can be run locally and in CI.

Purpose: prove end-to-end tenant isolation at runtime using the real DB connection (not mocks).

Requirements
	1.	Uses two test tenants: tenant_smoke_a, tenant_smoke_b.
	2.	Creates minimal rows in at least 3 tenant-aware tables (choose from: forex_signals, forex_config, bot_config, telegram_subscriptions, campaigns, etc.).
	3.	Verifies:
	•	Reads scoped by tenant return only the correct tenant’s rows.
	•	Updates scoped by tenant do not affect the other tenant.
	•	A “wrong tenant update” returns False / no-op (whatever your db functions return), and the row remains unchanged.
	4.	Must clean up after itself (delete inserted rows) even if an assertion fails (use try/finally).
	5.	Must accept:
	•	--tenant-a, --tenant-b overrides
	•	--keep-data flag to skip cleanup for debugging
	6.	Exit codes:
	•	0 on success
	•	1 on failure (print a clear failure reason)
	7.	Should not require server running. It should import db and connect directly.

Output Example
	•	Print a compact checklist:
	•	✅ Insert A/B
	•	✅ Read isolation
	•	✅ Update isolation
	•	✅ Wrong-tenant no-op
	•	✅ Cleanup

Also update the Makefile:
	•	make smoke → runs the smoke script
	•	Add it to make ci only if SMOKE_DB=1 env var is set (CI shouldn’t require a real DB unless explicitly enabled)

B) Tenant-Aware Metrics Dashboard (minimal + useful)

Add lightweight metrics endpoints and internal aggregation:

1) DB query helper
	•	Add db.get_tenant_metrics(tenant_id, days=7) returning:
	•	counts of signals created/closed
	•	count of active signals
	•	bot_usage count (if relevant)
	•	subscriptions created + converted (if present)
	•	basic error counts if you have an error_type column (bot_usage has it)
Keep it fast: aggregate via SQL with WHERE tenant_id = %s and date filtering.

2) API endpoint
Add GET /api/metrics/tenant?days=7:
	•	Auth-protected (same auth scheme you use for admin/tenant endpoints)
	•	Uses tenant_id from request context (NOT from querystring unless admin)
	•	Returns JSON like:
