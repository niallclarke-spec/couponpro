Fix the “Loading…” user chip in the authenticated UI.

CURRENT BEHAVIOR
- After login, the avatar/user chip shows “Loading…”
- Clicking still reveals “Sign Out” which works
This means the UI is waiting on Clerk user hydration but it never resolves.

GOAL
- If authenticated, immediately render a stable user chip using the SERVER as source of truth.
- Then enhance it with Clerk user data if/when available.
- Never show “Loading…” indefinitely.

REQUIREMENTS
1) Update admin.html auth UI logic:
   - On auth success, fetch /api/check-auth (or existing auth endpoint) and make it return JSON with at least:
     { "authenticated": true, "email": "...", "avatarUrl": null }
     If backend already returns email, use it. If not, add minimal backend change to include email from the verified Clerk token.
   - Use that email immediately to render the chip (fallback avatar = first letter).
   - Only show “Loading…” for max 500ms, then fall back to the email-based chip.
   - If Clerk user later becomes available, update avatarUrl/email, but do not block initial render.

2) Fix Clerk client hydration:
   - Ensure Clerk is loaded only once.
   - After load, call:
     await window.Clerk.load()
     const user = window.Clerk.user
   - If user is null after load but server auth is true, don’t keep waiting—use the server email.

3) UI behavior:
   - Authenticated state must show: avatar + email (or truncated) + dropdown caret
   - Dropdown contains: Sign Out
   - Sign Out must:
     - call window.Clerk.signOut() if available
     - call existing backend logout endpoint (if present)
     - then force UI to logged-out state

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
- Add a small helper like:
  - renderUserChip({email, avatarUrl})
  - setAuthUI(authenticated, userData)
- Add a timeout guard:
  - start a timer when authenticated UI begins
  - if Clerk user not available after 500ms, render using server userData and clear loading state

DELIVERABLE
- Update admin.html (and server.py only if needed) so “Loading…” never persists.
- The chip shows the real email quickly and still supports Sign Out reliably.

Proceed to implement now.
