Fix Clerk JWKS “Unable to find a signing key” auth failures

We are seeing repeated auth failures:

JWKS fetch failed: Unable to find a signing key that matches: "<kid>"
This causes /api/set-auth-cookie to log user from JWT = None and no cookie is set, resulting in login redirects.

Goal: Fix Clerk JWT verification so admin auth works on admin.promostack.io.

Constraints:
	•	Do NOT disable JWT verification.
	•	Do NOT add insecure fallbacks that bypass auth.
	•	Keep server.py thin (routing only). Implement logic in existing auth modules/middleware.

Tasks:
	1.	Locate Clerk auth verification code
	•	Find where we fetch JWKS and verify JWTs (likely clerk_auth module or middleware).
	•	Identify what environment variables/config values it uses for:
	•	Clerk Issuer (iss)
	•	JWKS URL
	•	Publishable key / secret key (if relevant)
	2.	Implement strict issuer + JWKS alignment
	•	Parse the incoming bearer JWT (and cookie JWT if used) and read:
	•	unverified header (kid)
	•	unverified payload iss, aud
	•	Ensure the backend’s configured CLERK_ISSUER matches the token’s iss exactly.
	•	Ensure JWKS is fetched from the correct Clerk issuer domain for that iss:
	•	Prefer using iss to derive JWKS, or validate config and fail fast with a clear error.
	•	If we currently hardcode a JWKS URL, update it so it always matches the configured issuer.
	3.	Add caching + refresh for JWKS
	•	Cache JWKS in memory with a TTL (e.g., 10–30 minutes).
	•	On verification failure due to missing kid, refresh JWKS once and retry verification (handles key rotation).
	•	If still missing, fail with a clear log message that includes:
	•	token iss
	•	expected CLERK_ISSUER
	•	requested kid
	•	JWKS URL used
	4.	Add a startup sanity check
	•	On boot, if CLERK_ISSUER is set, fetch JWKS once and log:
	•	issuer used
	•	JWKS URL used
	•	number of keys found
	•	If fetch fails, log a single high-signal warning explaining likely causes:
	•	frontend using different Clerk instance than backend
	•	wrong env vars
	•	wrong domain (dev vs prod)
	5.	Add a lightweight debug endpoint (admin-protected or internal)
	•	Create GET /api/auth-debug (must be protected or restricted to local/dev) returning:
	•	configured issuer + jwks url
	•	last jwks refresh time
	•	number of keys cached
	•	Do NOT return secrets or full tokens.
	6.	Re-test with shell commands
Provide exact commands to confirm fix:
	•	Print configured issuer/jwks:
python3 - <<'PY' ... PY
	•	Hit /api/set-auth-cookie and confirm user is resolved and cookie set.
	•	Confirm /admin no longer redirects.

Deliverables:
	•	Code changes in the appropriate auth module(s), not server.py.
	•	Clear logs for issuer mismatch vs JWKS missing key.
	•	Robust JWKS refresh on key rotation.
	•	Minimal tests (unit test for issuer mismatch + kid refresh path if test framework exists).

Important: The fix must ensure frontend and backend use the SAME Clerk instance/environment (prod-prod or dev-dev). If mismatch is detected, log it explicitly and refuse auth.
