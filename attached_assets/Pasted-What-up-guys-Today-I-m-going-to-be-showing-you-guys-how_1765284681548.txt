0:43
got. All right this video is going to be divided into three parts. uh just pray that I have the strength to continue.
0:49
But today I'm going to take you part one of it. It is very important and it's like the foundation. So pay attention
0:55
and let's go. All right. So this is the collective class. I'm showing people how to do it live. There are people watching
1:02
us live now on YouTube about 200 people because I make it private and there like a few guys here on my personal student
1:10
which I'm taking as well. So let's get on the live with that.
1:17
All right. So let's let's let's proceed guys. Okay. We have Dub there.
1:22
We have them there now. Hi guys. Em is live too. All right. So uh the topic is
1:30
how to trade good. How to trade
1:37
let's say USD.
1:43
I mean good over the years has had some funny name like uh uh they'll tell you
1:50
good can make you good can break you and uh good can send you to village right
1:56
and if there's any pair that if you want to come which give profits very fast I
2:01
think we can all talk about gold right and gold is a very interesting pair
2:07
for all of us all right so uh I think you you pay attention to this class and
2:14
try to learn. If you have any question along the way, feel free to ask me. Okay. Are we good to go?
2:22
Yes, sir. All right. So, I'm going to be sharing my screen now. Um
2:28
[Music] my live chat.
2:34
I mean before we go to the practical aspect, there are some few things I need
2:39
to list out for you when it comes to God. Right? There's some pre precaution
2:44
you must have in your mind when it comes to trading gold. Now when it comes to trading gold, you need to understand
2:50
that gold movement is different from currencies, right? Gold move faster in
2:56
trend, right? Gold pips is higher percentage on
3:04
profit is higher than normal currency. Which I mean if you see 20 pips on gold is very tiny. And if you see 20 pips on
3:12
like maybe currency it might be very big. So you need to know the difference now because is the most volatile and the
3:18
contract size is different. All right. So you need to understand this when it comes to gold. Now over the years what
3:25
are the things that's been helping me to make money on gold more often. right
3:31
now. I study gold because I sat down and I and I reason it out that okay, if I'm going to be making money on this pair
3:38
like what has he really been doing? Now, I'll quickly take you guys to the monthly history of gold since maybe I
3:47
can quickly run you through maybe since uh 2000. All right, you can see the
3:52
history here. Now, if there's one thing that you see about this chart, what can you see since 2000?
4:00
This is 2000 year. What guys, what can you guys see?
4:06
God has been bullish. Has been always been bullish. But does that mean that it doesn't come down or it doesn't have
4:13
some retracement? No, it does have retracement. It does
4:20
has retracement, but one thing is sure, it must always go up because gold is an
4:25
asset, right? If you're wearing gold, it is an asset. And if you're going to sell
4:30
your gold today, as of today, you're going to be selling it at this price, 333 $3391,
4:38
right? Gold has moved from 2,000 to 3,000 plus over a few months, right? So
4:46
now, gold started all the way from like $400 per ounce or whatever they sell it
4:52
with to 3,000. So it's an increasing asset. is more of like stock. All right.
4:59
Over the time. Now, one thing you must know in this when it comes to trading
5:04
gold, gold always moves in trend. Now, because we are a day trader and it
5:12
means that we need to do whatever is happening now. Number one priority is for you to follow what the daily trend
5:19
of God. What do I mean in this case? So now what I mean by you to follow the daily trend
5:25
of gold in this case, this is where you need to go back to study your market structure.
5:31
All right, I've done a video on market structure. Uh you guys have it in your video course. Yes or no?
5:41
You guys have the video on on the video on your video course, right?
5:49
So when it comes to the daily trend of gold all it simply means that what you
5:54
need to follow the trend of whatever is happening now. So if the market is
5:59
telling you that okay overall is bullish that means what you need to be what to be buying with it. Does that make sense?
6:10
Yeah. That is it. So now the number one priority when it comes to trading gold
6:15
is what? Follow the trend. Now because gold has been going up over
6:22
the time or over the years doesn't mean that you just come in from nowhere and you just buy right and I remember I told
6:29
you that the percentage on profit moves faster right is the volatility is in is higher
6:36
the contract size is higher which means that one loss one single move small move
6:41
can be giving you huge losses so you need to be careful all right except
6:47
maybe you're a very good swing trader And maybe you find a good entry to just buy gold and you can hold for like maybe
6:53
years whatever you want to hold for. But over time we've already understand that gold is an appreciating asset.
7:01
One that's one thing you must understand. But because it's an appesting asset doesn't mean that we
7:07
just buy or we just keep buying. Right? What you want to do is that this day trader you want to look for in
7:14
day-to-day opportunity where you can always spot the activities and what jump
7:20
in. So now in this case you're up for what? Buy and you're up for what? Sell.
7:26
But most likely in the case you're going to be buying because what gold is always bullish in most cases, right? In most
7:34
cases God is always bullish. But it doesn't mean that it doesn't sell. It sells. Now I'll give you an example. Now
7:43
I've given you number one rule which is what? Always follow the trend of the the market. Whatever the structure is giving
7:49
you. Number two is you need to study the structure because the structure is like your foundation when it comes to gold.
7:58
If you don't get the foundation right, you're most likely going to miss your way because the foundation is like your
8:03
building house. And if the foundation is not solid, the house will collapse. So when it comes to analysis go you must
8:08
make sure the structure is precise. Now when it comes to market structure
8:14
how many type of structure do we have? Anyone guys I want this to be very
8:21
interactive so that everybody can learn you can unmute yourself. Good evening.
8:26
Yeah. Good evening Mr. Abin. Yeah good evening. Yeah, we have a based on what I
8:34
know we have we have two major type trend and ranging. Then there's the
8:39
third one is choppy that is learn. So ranging market is same thing as choppy
8:44
market. Then we have bullish and what bearish market. All right.
8:51
So now don't forget how do you mark out when something is bullish?
8:58
You know, in a bullish trend, I've taught all this before. So, if in case you don't understand this, you need to go back to the previous video. In a
9:05
bullish trend, you need to have at least two higher highs and two higher lows. Now, look at this particular chart that
9:11
we're seeing right now. Right? If I'm going to analyze this chart, what is the trend of this current
9:18
market? Just guess from looking at it. What would you guys say is the current trend of this market?
9:26
Bullish trend. is bullish trend, right? Why is it bullish trend?
9:32
It's creating a series of higher highs and higher lows. So now if we're going to study, you'll see that this market
9:38
over the time has been creating higher highs, higher low, higher high, higher
9:43
low, higher high, higher low, higher, high, higher low. Then new one
9:51
is coming. This one is creating. This one definitely will go and give us a new higher eye right very soon. But right
9:58
now it's just doing as if it's coming down. You should know that what this thing will definitely it will go up.
10:06
All right. Because what the market is bullish so I'm going to be doing anything on this market. The only thing I'll do is look for opportunity to buy.
10:13
So the number two is what? Making sure your structure is correct. You have to be precise whether this market is
10:19
bullish or is bearish. So now another thing is this. You know that we have minor structure and we have major
10:24
structure right in this case. Now the major structure is bullish and the minor structure I need to go to like the 1
10:31
hour time frame and ensure that the minor structure is also what is also bullish
10:36
1 hour time frame lower. Now you can see okay this is where the price is look at the minor structure here. Now you can
10:44
see that it's also bullish right because what if you're going to calculate it from here you have series
10:50
of I I low I I higher low I high I higher low
10:58
I higher I high I higher lower I higher low equal I lower low at this point
11:06
right now this lower low does this mean that this is a bearish market what is
11:11
happening here does that mean that it's a bearish market or because this price is dropping like
11:17
this. Is it a bearish market? No. No, it is not a bearish market yet
11:22
because you don't even see series of lower lows yet. Mhm. So now what do I
11:28
do? This is when this zone come to play. [Music]
11:34
So I have a question before you proceed. Yeah. Yeah, sure. Uh where you put this cycle? Yeah, true.
11:43
Uh it has created a structure like double top and later create a lower low.
11:50
Yeah. So look at it. This is not a perfect structure yet. One, this is 1 hour time frame. Two, the market has
11:57
been strolling bearish. Now look at this double top.
12:02
Is he correctly on the same place? No. No. No. This one was higher I high.
12:12
[Music] Yeah, this one was high IR. What this one is doing now is going to retest it.
12:18
So now if I'm going to look, like I said, this is not a bearish strength for me. So if I'm going to look for anything, I will look for the support.
12:25
Currently, this should have been the support here. This should have been a support level
12:31
because what? This was the last place that the price broke out. This was the last high that the price broke out, right? But you see that the price broke
12:38
low and again the last support that we have here will now be this one again
12:43
right which is on this level. So now what I will be waiting for is what I'll be waiting for the price to come back to this level. Then at this level is where
12:50
I'll be thinking of what probably buying as of now. Are you getting it?
13:00
Because of the structure the zone. Don't forget guys that guys.
13:07
Now, let me quickly show you guys something. Under our curses.
13:15
[Music]
13:23
[Music]
13:34
Now this is the course if you click on the link that you have in your group. This is our courses here right you need
13:40
to watch this number three video how to identify market trends continuation of
13:47
bullish and intro to bearish just watch this four videos back to back right so
13:52
that you can understand structure more I believe you guys should if you are very serious you should have actually watched
13:58
these four videos have you anyone yet? Yeah, I actually watch it but it was
14:06
only once. Yeah, you need to watch it back to back to understand. Take your time.
14:12
Yeah, the video is in in your is in your email. So, go through it. That's our cause.
14:18
No, I have not received any email yet. H can you mention can you comment on the
14:24
group so that we can look at it? Okay. All right. So, I should send my
14:31
email. Yeah. Yeah. So in a short note, all I'm saying is this. When you're trading gold, follow
14:36
the trend. Now, I don't really care about this cell that is happening. All I'm waiting for is just for this price
14:42
to come to the next support so that I can wait for opportunity to buy. Cuz in most cases, when gold go back up is
14:49
going with fire. Do you understand? This is a bullish trend and you shouldn't go against it.
14:56
Are you guys with me? Yes, I am. Now I now said on a zone
15:05
there's a three different way you can actually identify a zone out right you can do support and resistance you can
15:11
use trend line or use Fibonacci if I'm going to use trend line in this case right this is my trend line I'm going to
15:16
connect from this levels and see now if I'm connecting from this levels
15:24
right this is even making it worse it's telling me that okay this price needs to come here
15:30
right to this trend line before this price can go up. So now in this case I might have to what? Be careful and wait
15:36
for this price to actually enter the trend lines zone before I can what think of buying.
15:43
Are you guys there? Yeah, I'm here. So now you just need to work it out. The
15:50
structure, the zone, those are the first primary thing that we're going to focus on.
15:58
If structure is bullish on the 4 hour time frame ensure that okay maybe if it's bullish you need to go to 1 hour
16:05
time frame or 15 minute time frame you need to ensure that what what is happening there the minor 10 is also
16:11
what bullish at the moment once they both correlate it shows that what no
16:16
matter how that chart will what it will go up at that point at that point because we want to see what is going on
16:21
right now we want to trade what is going on right now at the moment does that make sense Makes
16:28
sense. So major structure is typically the higher time frame. So say 4 hours,
16:34
daily or maybe weekly something. You really don't have anything to do with monthly. Your time frame as a day trader
16:40
should be daily, 4 hour, 1 hour, uh 30 minute, 15 minute, 5 minutes.
16:46
All right. So now once you've like I said the 15 minutes, 1 hour below you
16:52
confirm that okay something is happening correlation. Once that is happening, mark it as tick one that okay this trade
16:59
must buy. The next thing for you to now say okay if this trade must buy you already know the market rule that says
17:06
buy when the price is low sell when the price is high right your low is your support your resistance is your what is
17:13
your high so now if it's a bullish trend obviously I'm buying I just need the
17:18
price to come back to a low and if I'm going to come back to a low this is now where you apply your normal support and
17:24
resistance and you apply your trend line you apply your Fibonacci all these three things they simply functioning as one
17:30
thing support and resistance and in the case of bullish trend the only thing that matters for us is what is bullish
17:38
trend uh sorry is is the support you just got to figure out the support
17:43
and wait for the price to come back to that support and what click to it
17:48
so if you're going to learn from this class that we just did now right the primary thing who can give me like the
17:55
primary point that I've explained so far when it comes to trading mode.
18:01
I think I mentioned three primary things. Always follow the trend.
18:08
One, follow the trend. Study the market structure. Study the market structure.
18:15
Then make sure the major structure and the minor structure are like basically the same direction. Good. That's three.
18:21
There's another one one more last thing.
18:28
take the last two low or last two highs. No, your support and resistance, right?
18:33
So, if you're jotting down, first thing is what? On gold, you must follow the trend at all cost. If you go against the
18:41
trend, you burn [Music] now. In the next class, I will explain
18:47
why you must follow the trend. Right. Second thing, make sure your market
18:54
structure is correlating with higher time frame and the lower time frame.
19:00
The both must say bullish. They must be like saying same thing. If one is saying bearish and one is saying bullish, just
19:07
ignore it. The trade is not ready for you at the moment.
19:13
All right. Another thing is what you need to execute on what support and resistance
19:21
level which is the general rule. Buy when the price is low sell when the price is
19:26
high. Right now I just want to give you guys an assignment which is watch the previous video on market structure
19:33
because if you cuz I don't want to start explaining market structure all the way again because we have the video already
19:40
and it's very simplified actually like cuz I put all my energy in that video. But if you actually take your time to
19:45
watch it, you will you will understand it. So watch that market structure video again so that you can understand this.
19:53
Market structure is very very basic and is very very important when it comes to
19:59
analyzing the market. Trust me, you will know until you start discipline and you
20:05
trade professionally. You you'll be surprised that it's the smallest thing in technical analysis
20:11
that makes you money. Not even all the baby grammar whatever that you you know
20:20
are you guys with me? Yeah. So now tomorrow now we're going to trade this pair because I want us to
20:27
follow up. Now you see where we've already marked out. Now this is my level of entry waiting for this price to come.
20:34
So by tomorrow now let's see what will happen. This is where we'll be looking to execute buy from.
20:43
All right. So, happy regardless of I hear you with
20:51
the technical analysis. Do you also take into consideration the news? Yeah. So,
20:57
for me, what do I actually use the news for? I only use the news to just support
21:02
the technical analysis because I know that at that point, that's when the time session is open or when the market is
21:08
actually more volatile like to move. You understand? Okay.
21:15
Makes sense.
21:21
We're waiting for it to to get to that level. So, I'm going to share the video to the to the group now. The video you
21:28
guys should watch. Please try to watch it and take your time. All right? And if you have any question while watching the
21:34
video, let me know. Then the part two will be tomorrow. I'll take you guys tomorrow on this so that we can continue
21:40
with this. All right, guys. Take care, guys. Thank you. All right.
21:47
Thanks, man. So, this is going to be the end of part one. Trading knowing how to
21:52
trade SUSD. It's not that intense, but trust me, if you're a very smart trader
21:58
and with a little I've shared, you will go make use of that and you come back to me, see how it works. That is if you're
22:04
a very smart trader. Put it together. One oneplus 1. Do your analysis. Try it
22:10
out for your one month trading history and come back to tell me Abby, you're the best. You know, see you. Wait for
22:17
the part two of this video so you can learn intensively on this part. All right. The part two is going to be
22:23
massive. I'll take my time to analyze and to to share the top down analysis with you guys. Make sure you subscribe
22:29
to this YouTube channel if you want to keep enjoying free education like this. Got you guys.
22:39
Now the SFR trade because what we most likely trade like gold, right? We trade
22:44
gold, isn't it? Now let's say SF we're using like 50 P because it's good. You
22:50
cannot use 20. It's very rare. Also see very realistic.
22:55
Don't forget all what we are doing right now is planning before trade
23:03
which is like the most underrated part of trading. You cannot just open an account and just immediately jump and
23:09
start trading. Very bad. You have to have a plan or add you want to do it
23:15
like me now. I withdrew all my profit today and I started back with
23:20
130k. Right now I have a new plan because before I was using you can see I
23:26
was using 100 100 lot size look at today now I've come back to 10 lots right I
23:33
can't use 100 because I've taken out my money so I have to come with a new plan
23:39
right that how will I grow this 100 again to a reasonable amount now this 10
23:44
lo size I'm using is not the lo size I will use right I most likely use like
23:50
lot I raise like 20 $20,000 per trade. I have like six Tesla
24:02
is 50. So you do 20 / 50
24:08
this will give you the lo size to use. So now what you're doing to get your lo
24:14
size to get this lo size right you're dividing this by what like this
24:23
0.0 what 0.04 right that means it's giving you
24:30
0.04 right there. So that means your lo size is 0.04 0 4
24:39
I don't know if you guys understand sorry yeah yeah 0.4 but you have it to like
24:47
dollars okay because now your account is 100 right you cannot use 04 0.4 is what
24:53
that's uh $4 you have to use cent do you understand so you just put zero
25:00
in front 0.04 04 assuming your account was like maybe this and that like 500
25:06
you can use. Do you guys understand?
25:12
Are you getting it? Fatima are you sure? You're looking lost.
25:22
How about you? Unlucky. Unlock your mind.
25:28
Did you get it? Yes, I did. Yes, big boy.
25:33
That the big best boy in the class now. Don't play with that.
25:39
The back. You've got it so far to the point. So now our lot size is now what?
25:46
0.04 lots. So now when you're writing your plan
25:52
down, just have it this way. List it down. What did you fund your account with? Read it here. This is what you
25:58
funded with. What losses are you using? Put it in comma first. Right? What is
26:03
the risk per trade? You put it there. What is the loss stop loss per trade? If
26:08
it's 50, then you now what? Divide the risk. You divide three with number four.
26:14
You give you what? This number two. A little bit of mathematics. All right?
26:20
But nothing serious. Do you understand? So now what is next after I already
26:26
figure out this? Because the most important thing now is figuring out this right now. What is next? The next thing
26:32
is what I now need to maintain what? Discipline and consistency. Discipline
26:38
and uh lot size consistency. Now what does this mean? The lo size consistency
26:45
simply means that you already know your lo size should be 0.4. So it means that
26:50
no matter anything whether you're in a loss whether you're in a profit your loss size per trade should be what is
26:57
0.1 what four if you're taking a new trade is different right
27:05
because what you accept that anytime you open the 0.04 Therefore, you're liable to lose what?
27:11
$20 with go. It's just like you've donate for that day.
27:16
I don't know. Let me get it. You need to open your mind now and accept the loss.
27:21
Anytime you take the the trade, you know that what? You know that what $10? $20
27:28
is what? It's gone. Make sense? Yes.
27:34
Right. Now, the discipline. Discipline is knowing what is right to be done and
27:40
actually following it right even if it might inconvenience you or even it might
27:46
what might be uncomfortable for you. Now you made a plan yourself
27:52
the discipline is what to follow it. It's as simple as that. Don't go against it. What might come is you might be like
27:58
ah I be as rough again. I made money yesterday today. Let me go double. No,
28:04
you stick to this that plan. If you find another amount is a
28:09
different thing. You know that you start again, right? Remember, I know that everybody want to make money. You want
28:16
to make or you start from somewhere. Give yourself time. No pressure. This your plan is it not just stay overnight.
28:22
You should not just come any day and be like, "No, today I'm using 0.9." No, it has to be that, okay, I've made
28:28
reasonable money. Maybe your account has grown from $1,000 now to like 2,000. You
28:34
cannot come again. I'll come again. Okay, now I have $2,000 account. I have to figure this out. I have this. I have
28:40
this. I have to maintain this lo size consistency. Whether you're in losses, you're making loss at the moment,
28:47
whether your account balance is down 50%, you must still what? Maintain it. Why? Because what? When you maintain the
28:53
loss size, it's easier for you to recover the amount you have lost, right? And it's easier for you to what? to
28:59
maintain the profit range as well. It's not be like you make profit with 0.04,
29:04
you lost with 0.10. How do you expect 0.04 to cover the loss of 0.10
29:12
except you make profit the profit the difference will be gap. But you know reality is this there's no way you make
29:18
profit is 0.10 which whereby your next trade you will definitely not increase the loss size. You understand right? So
29:26
this first thing is just a prominent thing when it comes of balls training together.
29:32
Right? The next thing is the the primary ones timing to when the thread drops,
29:38
right? You need to be always active. Whenever they tell you active, you should be active.
29:45
All right? Take the trade immediately at one. Don't close trade. when they've
29:50
not tell you to close. All right. If you're taking a loss, if you're scared,
29:56
hold it until they tell you to close. You guys are always chatting on the group.
30:01
You guys, you people don't don't voice. You are proud.
30:12
You guys are proud. You can be active as a group. So like whenever trade drops you can always ask
30:18
them if there's something wrong and maybe you're not in class you can test and ask can I close the trade are you
30:23
guys still holding now if you see people still to boost your morale okay uh I
30:29
should I should keep ordering you understand just follow this follow what everybody is doing at the moment
30:34
I was respons they were abusive
30:40
abusive but it's like she clos like they can be service sometimes
30:50
But you you can see somebody will surely respond good. Do you understand? Yeah. Especially the the Kab.
31:06
[Music] All right. So that's this one is is for us right now. Let's go to your personal
31:12
self. This is a long list. I'll be out there. Yeah.
31:21
[Music]
31:32
All
31:44
[Music]
31:52
right. So what this does is continuation for
31:58
you to trade together. All right. So this is individual
32:08
[Music]
32:14
individual trading setup or trading plan anyone.
32:22
So now in this case you must have done the first five thing because the first
32:28
five thing is like the primary planning when you fund. All right it doesn't have anything to do with technical analysis.
32:34
It doesn't have anything to do with uh proper money management. All right this is just like the primary planning on how
32:41
you take trades. Do you understand? How you want to grow your account? Do you understand? This is your stuff. Now this
32:47
is where number six is now where we go to technical analysis. All right. Now
32:54
this is what is my technical strategy.
33:00
You ask yourself that question. [Music]
33:11
[Music] Now, if you're going to be sincere with
33:19
yourself, do you think do you guys think that you have a pattern of the way you trade right now?
33:26
Do you really think you have a pattern, a particular way you trade? That means you have a long way to go.
33:34
Why is it called strategy? Strategy is what you consistently use to achieve something,
33:40
right? So, you need to have a strategy. You need to have like an approach to the
33:48
market. You're not just coming to the chat and you just like you just do any random thing and you be like you're
33:54
good. No, I have to have a particular way that I approach every time I come to
33:59
this market. And that's where you need to ask yourself that specific question. If your answer is what I don't have a
34:05
technical strategy that I can explain, just what step back you have a long way to go. Don't fun.
34:14
But if you can say okay I have a simple wig that I think has worked over the time and maybe it's a simple trend line
34:21
that you always follow maybe a simple support and resistant you always follow that's fine that means what you have a
34:27
way how you trade you just need to have a method because
34:33
without a method without a strategy everything you're doing you're just playing around you're gambling
34:40
all right Now that number six is the next topic
34:46
that we're going to which I'm going to teach you guys how we use the new tire
34:51
right and how we actually analyze step by step how to analyze the market that's
34:57
the top down analysis all right now number seven
35:03
once you have a technical strategy how you approach the market how you do the stepby-step analysis number is Uh,
35:15
how good is your entry?
35:20
Number six. I'm sorry, number seven.
35:40
So number seven is how to exit and enter a trade. Do you have a way? What is your
35:47
discipline to this? Because what it's not just a matter of entering a trade. Do you know how to what? Exit. Can you
35:55
exit peacefully? Remember we mentioning a pro a problem that of course to all of
36:01
us is when you're in a trade and what you don't want to take the loss you keep adjusting stop loss that is what your
36:08
exit plan you don't know how to exit a trade cuz why die on a trade when there's
36:15
tomorrow why must you blow your account today
36:21
because one trade is not going in your favor and you be like let me keep adding to it when there's tomorrow because
36:28
every day in the market is an opportunity but not opportunity for you. It can be an opportunity for you today,
36:35
right? No opportunity for you today and tomorrow might be your own opportunity. You know why? Because what this what
36:42
this number six is different for all of us.
36:47
Everybody has different approach. Do you have a strategy to use or you know last strategy might be different? Uh, vaginal
36:54
sorry vaginals right I remember I still have good memory right so your own strategy
37:02
might be what very different why you guys laughing your trade has gone
37:08
let me see let me see
37:14
[Music]
37:20
[Music] smash Oh yeah, I said I was going to take paralysis for you.
37:31
I I think it will actually hit your stop loss.
37:36
I think you should just close. Thank the Lord. Just something sad.
37:46
A woman.
37:51
It's okay. It's okay. Now, let's proceed, guys.
37:59
At the back. Yes. What's happening? Your face is strong. You sure? Did you
38:06
lose money? Who is a bouncer? Are you sure you're okay?
38:15
Feel free to speak up for all right. Let's proceed. Like I said,
38:20
it's not just about entering. Your exit plan also matters.
38:25
That's where discipline comes in on all way. I told you guys earlier if you
38:31
budgeted to lose $20, right? And you see that, okay, like the way
38:36
she's on the trade now, right? I can tell that this trade would definitely most likely come back here with where
38:42
your stop loss is, right? So, what is the point of winning the trade and open
38:48
when I can just take $1 loss instead of losing $3? $3.
38:54
Exit plan. You're not what attached emotionally. You've taken it because as you take it
39:01
now, if you get another good trade, it will be easy for you to recover. $3 will be added to your cover because what you
39:08
spend more time do you understand? That's it.
39:15
All right. Now, that's just one plan under what how to exit a trade. Second thing is if a trade
39:22
is going against you, why do you really need to increase the stop loss
39:28
when most likely like what you increase the stop loss maybe by 10 pips, 20 pips, the trade will still come and meet you
39:34
where the stop loss is and what is doing is what it's only what making you to
39:39
lose more money. Are we there? So why do it in the first
39:45
place? He said what? Wherever you set your stop loss, let it be. you will recover tomorrow.
39:53
Another thing is what? Entering of the trade. How do you enter a trade? Remember I told you guys about timing.
40:01
What are our accounting like to enter a trade?
40:10
Now I'm talking about time session now. Okay. New York. Now this is London and New
40:16
York. You know that you have limited time to trade, right? So you should only stick on your head that any time that is
40:23
not between London and New York and you have nothing to take a trade. You cannot enter a trade between that time.
40:30
Midnight you should not enter a trade. Right now you're trading USD KPY. Are we
40:36
in New York section?
40:41
Oh, it's at 2 p.m. New York. in near section but I don't think you you take it around near section. So if you're
40:47
going to take anything right now, it should be between now. Anything that has to do with USD, Canadian dollar, it
40:52
should be between now that what you're taking the trade, right?
40:57
Don't forget the timing. London session is between 7 a.m. to 11:00 a.m.
41:04
Why? New York session is between 1:30 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. But just take it like
41:10
the session close for new section at least. Anything past 5, don't take trade again. is gone and most time that you
41:17
take trade should be between 1:30 2 3:30 3 right cuz you if you study very well
41:24
right you see that most time that I drop trade you are always falling between any of this time
41:31
you understand now second thing entering of a trade you must learn not to revent
41:36
trending event trending is very very Ah
41:45
because now if you take a loss now right what is next is what you want to recover
41:51
yes gold gold same thing if you're trading gold and maybe you
41:57
take a loss right and you lo or is that not what you ask no time to take the oh
42:02
gold is near your section right that's between 1:30 to this thing but sometime
42:08
gold moves London session but not too much right in most learn section but most likely most near section that's
42:16
primary time so like I was saying
42:24
the venturing is one thing that will kill you faster right if you cannot accept loss losses
42:31
so you must be willing to accept the loss take it and come back tomorrow it's
42:36
better like I said one thing is that what your mind cannot take is that loss
42:43
and that's where the fear comes in. Once your mind can take it right, you can go
42:49
a day, you can take $10 loss, you know that tomorrow there's possibility for you to come back
42:55
you'll be okay. Now for her now that she has made like $500 now if she lose $10 or $20 in a day
43:03
right I don't expect her to what to start panicking but you know what happen she will still most likely what panic do
43:11
in discipline and what how the market just affects your head
43:17
but once you have it at your mind and you've already studied how this thing is right you know that I've already made a
43:24
lot of money why should I p tomorrow I'll go again Because once you start doing as if you need that money, you
43:29
need to make it that day, you lose everything. It's true.
43:36
So you need to also act like you don't need it, right? [Music]
43:44
That's just the truth. It might it might sound, but you need to act like you don't need the money, right? Go a day
43:50
without taking a trade. Go two days without taking a trade, but you are active on the chart. You see what I'm
43:56
saying? Yes. So go getting close. He knocked you out.
44:08
So all right. No, no problem.
44:15
Like I was saying is very very bad. You need to what? Just accept the loss and
44:20
move on. All right. Move on. Now the next thing apart from exit and
44:27
entering a trade right so number eight is just talking about risk management
44:32
self control and patience all right now the risk management there is whenever
44:37
you're taking a trade you need to always understand before you take a trade right
44:44
make sure you've already calculate the stop loss very well on the market and make sure that whenever you're setting
44:50
your stop loss you're setting it at the appropriate places. Now, risk management there is talking about setting stop loss
44:56
on your chart. You're not setting stop loss because you want to lose more money. All right? You're setting stop
45:02
loss because that's the appropriate place that supposed to be under self control. Self control simply means
45:10
holding yourself right now. Trying to do the right thing. You already have a plan. So, stick to it.
45:18
All right. Now in this part I told you as a trader you have to be more rational. I cannot come here and all the
45:25
time I just tell you do this because I want you to do it or because of what I think you to do this. I have to do what
45:32
I'm saying. Do you understand? You have to be a rational trader which you have to do
45:39
every decision out of what? Reasoning. Put every fact together and ask yourself
45:45
okay is this the best thing to do? Is this the best thing to do right now? All right. And patience.
45:52
Patience when a train is going your way. All right. If a train is going your way,
45:59
it means you're doing something right. If it's going wrong your way, it means
46:04
what? You're doing something wrong. So, you know what to do, isn't it?
46:10
Isn't it? Yes. So, you have to also be patient,
46:16
especially when something is going your way. It means that there's more where it comes from. So if you're making like a
46:22
$2 on a trade now, it means that you can make more but it will just take you longer time and like you must express
46:28
you might be making some profit, right? And maybe the profit might decrease, right? If it decrease and it's not going
46:34
to hit your stop loss, it's not coming to break even. It's only preparing to what to go further.
46:41
Do you understand? And that's how you work.
46:48
Now the most important part in this case now is this. This all right and this
46:55
this comes first. You having a strategy and I think that one is just like
47:00
another thing entirely top analysis.
47:10
So now let's pray into practice. I have confirmed that this thing is bullish. Number one marked major trend
47:17
mar bullish. We've not done min right now. I want to buy when the price is
47:24
low. Where is our low in this case?
47:29
[Music] Yes. Look at it very well.
47:35
Like you need this one. Yeah.
47:42
No, you wouldn't use the current one. You know this one is coming. You need a
47:47
load to buy to bounce back something. Which one? This one.
47:52
No, this one. This one. Yes. This one. Yes.
47:58
So if you ask me all the way from here, you cannot find any law.
48:05
Apart from this now quick one let's do example
48:11
how do you find low anytime when price is dropping it means that what this
48:16
point that price back that's your low right support if the price comes back
48:23
and break this support right that means this support is what this
48:29
right and if the price going back of this point is Because support if it goes back here right
48:40
what rule does does apply here right because what this is now resistor but
48:45
let's assume it broke above this resistor come to what support
48:50
right so now look at the structure now according to the rule of structures structures are always coming this
49:03
Right? Which means that what this last side that was broken is the support
49:09
price can come back here and what back.
49:14
So look at similar thing we have here. Look at here now.
49:23
I broke out came back here to work. This is broke out came back here to this last
49:30
low to what? Rebound. No, this one is not in ret. This one is equal. But you
49:35
can still call in right now. Look at the last line here.
49:42
We that's why here down here,
49:49
but it couldn't go all the way up. It didn't give you higher I that's why
49:55
this price is not going up now. It needs that support to what to go higher. So now the last support that we have here
50:02
is this point. So you look at it right here. [Music]
50:07
My support right here. This is it because this was the last higher eye that was broken. They gave us this
50:14
assuming this price has gone up. This will be my last support. Do you understand? actually and if you look at
50:21
the price carefully you see that we already have this bounce which means that what it was already working but the
50:27
price did not just give you higher high that's why the price is coming back down to the support and it has come back down
50:33
to the support it gives you that what there's another opportunity for what this market is not very structive
50:43
by what by this it's what this retracement the major structure there is
50:50
still what bullish. So now the next question is this. Why is
50:56
this thing not buying on this support yet? Why is it what? Why is it fishing?
51:02
Now look at yesterday. Now you see that all my signal is what? Why? Because you
51:09
are following the trend. No matter what this thing will what you have it is still going to work by
51:19
you now you've gotten where first question of
51:25
your where simply by applying the what row one and row two
51:31
now in the market you can find two ways to buy from this is your first point you
51:37
might also want to look at it okay let me try out my trend line because the first one we just did is what support?
51:44
Let me try my trend line. How do you use the trend line? You know to use a trend line you need to connect from the two
51:50
recent high if it is a bearish trend two recent lower high. So now if I'm going
51:56
to draw this one here I'll draw from from this two point one two
52:03
then third one will be when it come back here will be my buying point GSM that's how
52:10
tren supposed to work right and don't forget what is the primary function of the trend line to help you manage zone
52:18
which is support and resistance which mean this rule does not change in the market this rule is permanent Right? You
52:27
only make use of it when the what is aligning with the trend. But you be I
52:32
just come to the market and because I know that you have to buy now I just come here because price is low I'll just
52:39
buy. Do you understand? No it is because of what the pre-existing structure that
52:45
will make you follow what this is saying. So now let's try the trend line. You can
52:51
try the trend line this case. Now you look for the two recent. [Music]
52:57
So now like I said we need to try out. So if you don't your last two recent
53:04
that is very obvious to connect with very obvious to connect with. Don't
53:10
forget you always need to make a trial. You don't need to like be precise with your eyes one draw. Now if I one this
53:17
one you see that they almost at the same level right. So I just make one of this my eye then this one is like very
53:24
obvious and this one is quite obvious. So I can draw
53:30
and it will make more sense for me. Let's see. Are you see so that means
53:35
that what inside this zone is a what? There's a chaos already which means that
53:40
when you should be looking what to buy
53:46
is giving you the support because this one is support right and you look buy
53:52
so you know that you're going to do anything right here you go to buy right but remember I said you're not
54:00
taking a trade on the 4hour time frame you're taking
54:05
trade on a lower time frame This is even I thought I analyzing
54:11
seriously the chart
54:16
but they say the same things nothing different now we go to the 1 hour time frame now
54:24
1 hour time frame my price is already inside my zone I just want to see what
54:30
is happening here I want to see the minor structure this is where the minor structure now comes Again
54:36
[Music] the final structure now has to be what aligning with the what the major I know
54:44
you get it this is how it work you already find that it's bullish on the frame this is your bullish setup it's
54:50
ready to buy you just need to confirm that what is happening here if you go to like 5 minute time frame it is also what
54:57
bullish bullish structure is everywhere this is how it is right you see now you
55:03
see price giving low lower I
55:08
just to see something like this on the 1 hour time frame or or the 15 minute time frame once you see it then you know what
55:14
same way you find a buy here same way you just okay my minus trend line
55:21
support okay I'm buying from here you understand so now let's go to 1 hour
55:26
time frame then you see five just two things if you
55:33
apply these two things correctly you will get the trend right now. Look at the 1 hour time frame.
55:40
The 1 hour time frame this time where you have to be skeptical. Is it time to enter the buy or not?
55:47
Can you see any significant reason for you to enter a buy yet? No. Right? Because on frame this one
55:55
looks like but it is still bearish. Right? So you know that it is not
56:00
aligning with the major. You need this thing to give you life
56:08
something like that or if you not see we've not done chart pattern or maybe if
56:13
you see chart pattern chart pattern like W pattern that will tell you that okay the buyers are in W pattern is maybe the
56:20
market come down like this right bring the neckline boom
56:28
sorry I That's right. Yes. So now obviously
56:35
this thing is not ready for the buy. So you now have to be what patient your
56:40
setup is already cooking. It's two things that can happen here right the
56:45
price broke down right and he doesn't buy it now or the price reverse back. If
56:53
the price is going to buy you know if it's not going to sell right you will
56:59
also know but it's more harder for you because what this is where emotion will play on you and you you decisive to say
57:07
okay I my trade is cooking I fear of missing out right I need to jump on the buy now
57:14
you understand but right now it's clearly not ready you understand clearly not ready so
57:21
let's go a 15 minute time frame is 15 time frame that you cannot see clearly.
57:31
Now look at the 15inut time frame. This one already looks like maybe triple
57:37
bottom like triple bottom reversal. But what is happening here?
57:44
Because if you want according to this silver right you have small profit but
57:50
you didn't push it very well the structure has not formed yet. So now what are we expecting? How will the
57:56
structure form? This is the neckline of this bottom right. You wait for this price to enter here.
58:04
Right? Then you buy from here or you see that the price broke below you buy this
58:10
one now as well. If it comes here and break below, you know that what it is not ready to buy. But if it bounce from
58:18
here and reject, you know that this is now what higher low. This is what your
58:24
first low. And if this high can I give you a new higher high at this point,
58:31
they just know that what the buy is fully booked. That's the entry here.
58:38
So could you take that last? Okay.
58:44
Now we are ready. We're ready to go. Yeah. The first question.
58:50
The next thing now is how to enter the trade because now this is where you get more uh uh more impatient on entering
58:59
the trade. Right now the trade is not fully booked because of what the minor control that happen right now. It is not
59:06
bullish. Right? And we not see like any bullish correction pattern maybe like W
59:11
pattern or maybe any strong bullish pattern like that. What we still see now
59:16
is that bearish because what you see that market was already bearish here.
59:23
You didn't see this on the 4hour time frame but look at it here. Y
59:28
I low I lower low lower high lower low.
59:39
This will give you a lower low. If this guy give you a lower low and broke that
59:44
4hour trend line or support then just know that it is just ready to what to sell.
59:52
the structure is about to change. Are you getting it? But if it doesn't give me a lower low in this case again and
59:59
break below this one right then it is ready to buy and I said look at this
1:00:06
level right now. This is your neckline of this triple bottom. 1 2 3 neck line.
1:00:12
Wait for the price to enter this point. See whether you see any by just be patient. And it's already it's not New
1:00:18
York time already. You need to work with time session. I think another thing you can just add quick one is uh your time
1:00:26
session. You need to know the day you're trading time session. London session is between
1:00:32
7 a.m. to like 11:00 a.m. You already passed London session. You're not taking trade now. The only time you can execute
1:00:39
now is what? New York section 1:30 p.m. to between 4 5 p.m. on 7 to 11:00 a.m.
1:00:48
New York 1:30 p.m. to 6 p.m. So I'm just going to wait and wait to see whether
1:00:55
this thing will break low lower low. If you get lower then you
1:01:00
know that what the old thing that you done you will do the same thing for in
1:01:06
this case which means that if this break low let's say price break low now what will you do
1:01:14
correct you wait for any work with this one say when the price is higher because
1:01:21
what your structure is now bearish right your structure is bearish you want
1:01:28
to money now. So you want what is now you don't wait for the price to come when it's high because you've already
1:01:33
confirmed it when you test. Exactly.
1:01:40
But right now you cannot say because what you going against what the major
1:01:46
this is just minor this can clear one that's why have to follow the major trend. All you just need right now is to
1:01:53
see the same thing that happen as major as what minor. You just need this to
1:01:59
form a bullish strength. So you just need two eyes two one
1:02:06
already formed one I already formed. You need what this is where I can probably
1:02:13
or maybe low that's all. And sometimes when trade is already
1:02:20
forming like this and because it's near section you will see clearly whether you give
1:02:26
the higher low or not. If you just give lower
1:02:32
you understand so now in this case you're not buy your reasoning both way
1:02:37
of what will happen. Do you understand? You see how we started our analysis
1:02:42
strictly on buy but when we came to lower these two is different right but
1:02:49
as a day we want to make money now so now I just talk to you about what how to make money now and how to make money the
1:02:55
same way use the structures along it's all about game of patience
1:03:03
and understanding the analysis nothing more than that so if I ask you will you do anything now
1:03:10
you're going to take. No, because if you do anything now is more like what 50/50 gambling
1:03:20
looks like. You see it by time is what is fully cooked. Now this kind of analysis you've already spent time on it
1:03:27
right which is there's one probability that you make more money on this because you've already invested your time on it.
1:03:34
It just come
1:03:44
you definitely not make money on that one. [Music]
1:03:50
And that's it. Understood. Now let's see this uh market by one SPM. Let's see how
1:03:56
you play that. Right. You can follow up with it. Uh how many of you will be able
1:04:03
to follow the rules I gave you guys from day one like your personal account the account you trade with us who does that
1:04:11
you did you have the account you trade with us and the account you trade yourself the account you trade with us
1:04:17
how it is um I funded about $10 it's $40 now $10 $40 I come by trade
1:04:28
with you but um my own personal account I don't started trading so I'm still doing my practicing to make sure that
1:04:35
the strategy I'm learning retail is strong enough um but I don't want to start trading because I have to do SMC
1:04:41
as well and then maybe back test see which one is you know better because
1:04:47
I have my back testing um with the back testing I have like a 40%
1:04:53
but I know that SMC has you know more refine strategy so I want to give the
1:04:58
master Let's see what Yeah, you know what you want. Just try it out and see
1:05:04
the one that is good for you. All right. I can't I'm sure. Yeah. The one you've
1:05:10
been training all the last one year that you've been disciplined because you have been disciplined trading with us. I
1:05:15
believe like this month apart from yesterday and this week that's only week
1:05:22
we've taken loss so far right all the trades has been winning. I expect everybody to be profit right it's only
1:05:28
if you have done uh made a mistake or you done something wrong that's when you
1:05:33
lost isn't it we agree to that
1:05:39
right so how about you did you where is your trading account you
1:05:45
mistake so what was your mistake I used the wrong website wrong website
1:05:52
uh I posted something on my story yesterday water. [Music]
1:06:00
You mentioned you learn from it, right? Use the appropriate law size suitable for your account and be consistent with
1:06:07
your lo size. The story of I mean the lesson from that you should be what? Consistency with the lo size you're
1:06:14
using. Use the appropriate lo size and pick the loss you can afford to take. All right. Learn from that. How about
1:06:20
you? What's your mistake? I use those big sides of the smart.
1:06:28
You guys are sitting down together. Two position.
1:06:44
So I still didn't step out at that moment. So I know that still
1:06:51
giving us more. So I jump
1:06:58
and I could not just because I feel like I can come back till my account went
1:07:04
down to $9 something. I don't
1:07:16
used to tell us that if you just so I remember telling that I just took
1:07:24
down my $9 I treat myself now. Okay, good. Now
1:07:30
another lesson from that is this one thing is discipline, right? Another
1:07:36
thing is greedy discipline there is what you already know the right thing to be done follow the instructions even when
1:07:43
it is uncomfortable for you right you ask you to take profit I'm telling you to take it because what probably I feel
1:07:49
like this will not go our way and obviously you know I'm doing something I'm doing on my account with you guys so
1:07:56
I if I want to make more money definitely you guys make more money as well I don't want to lose I don't want
1:08:01
you guys to lose right and the greedy part is you want to make more money in a
1:08:08
day. The money will not come all in one day, right? It is better to take it slow. The moment you realize that it is
1:08:15
better to take it slow, right? That's when you start becoming profitable.
1:08:20
One thing that is a trader is you want to just make that just fill that account one day. You just want to make
1:08:27
everything one day, right? But the moment you understand that studying process is better, I don't mean that you
1:08:34
should be too low which means make $1, right? No. And then you cannot make crazy amount of money every day too.
1:08:41
That would be too risky. You can stay in the middle and what float float float.
1:08:47
Do you understand? And that's it. How about you?
1:08:55
I don't follow one account but I myself. You traed it yourself. How did it go?
1:09:02
Good. It's good. How much you made so far? How many%? Oh, I I put $20. I mean,
1:09:09
I'm not $1,000. You have $1,000. I made you
1:09:16
from $200 to $1,000. That's great. So you're currently trading BTC your for
1:09:24
No, USD boy. Let me see your history.
1:09:33
Okay. Is in $700 profit. That's good. Amazing. Amazing. So you trade all this
1:09:40
yourself? Yes. So one question I will ask you now is why haven't you withdraw?
1:09:49
I don't know when I started I want to drag that's very bad no matter what.
1:09:54
That's very bad for beginner trader, right? Because what one single mistake
1:10:00
psychology will affect you. It affects everybody. I I mean it doesn't mean that
1:10:05
your plan wouldn't work out, but you might just every every woman you're you're you're likely to just get into
1:10:13
that desperation mode one day and you be like, "Ah, I broke this. I can't let me
1:10:19
risk it today." The day you decide to risk it, it goes. The day you decide not to take the small loss
1:10:26
like now you $200, right? You know the best thing to do. At least withdraw like
1:10:31
$600. Start with $400. You started with double what you started with. Try to go to $400 and see whether you can do it
1:10:38
again, right? You grow again. Whenever you make profit, you take it out like that in the little flow. You know that
1:10:45
no, I'm already in profit for this cuz I used to.
1:10:52
But my opinion is 0.2. You see? So now your risk is going up. So you need to watch be very much
1:10:58
careful. All right. That's good. That's good. Well done. So uh let's watch out
1:11:03
the trend and see don't this one will still come down. It needs to come down. This way you will
1:11:10
probably know for now. All right. Any question guys? Any question?
1:11:19
No question. I I have a question. So, um I saw what
1:11:26
you said on the Telegram this morning, the partnership with that program. Yeah. So, I want to know um because some of us
1:11:34
won't actually do this um as I believe in it. Exactly. And I think the mindset
1:11:41
that you have mindset that you should have how to scale and it is with partnerships like this. I think I I
1:11:47
think I just get what you said right. So now I think this is good cuz I always actually give orientation like this by
1:11:54
when you guys are taking your certificates right but since you're here I can share with you guys now. So now
1:12:00
you see this trading world is big for everybody watching right this trading
1:12:05
world is big and there's a lot of opportunities in it now I'm going to share everything about it you right
1:12:14
training itself and the skills is the mental of every I mean it's the foundation what lays the foundation
1:12:21
because if you don't have the skills if you don't have the trading knowledge you cannot prove to somebody that you can
1:12:27
make $1 $2 it is totally what? Useless, right? So then you've already make your
1:12:33
first step coming to the academy to learn and but you still have a long process to go to actually master it. Cuz
1:12:40
I told you guys 1 month, 2 months will not make you profitable. It's a joy uh 2
1:12:46
years 1 year business. That's if your dedication is worth
1:12:52
ultimate. Now so trading itself and this trading
1:12:57
is what libraries me and I'll tell you this is where I make like maybe 70% of
1:13:02
my money from right two you have what mentorship
1:13:13
now because offers what the ability for you to what to actually pass through
1:13:19
knowledge and the good thing about this is what when I started I start based on
1:13:24
I want to make money from people right people come to me and be like cuz I always post my stuff and be like this
1:13:32
thing you're doing can you teach me can you show me at least I didn't come to your house knock at you okay come to the
1:13:38
academy you saw what we do here and decide okay you want to come right now
1:13:44
because of the knowledge I have from my student and my trading skills and my trading results right this led to people
1:13:51
asking okay can you teach me as And for me to teach you right cuz at
1:13:58
some point I used to teach people for free and when people value they give small money they make some money. If
1:14:04
some people also loses as well you get bad comments you know but the good was
1:14:09
more than the bad. So as I'm find I think as of 2020
1:14:15
that's when I thought about it and I started mentoring people. I started mentoring online and it became a thing
1:14:23
because when I mentor one person and one person is doing well I'm able to brag about this guy I'm sure you see online
1:14:29
most of all these are guys everybody in the academy yeah they start from like where you guys are you know and when
1:14:37
able to this guy see this guy doing well who's your mentor you probably want to come to Abby or you
1:14:43
want to learn from him it became a chance you that now I charge you for this
1:14:51
right now. This is where the business part comes in. This is turning into business. But the good thing about this
1:14:58
business is that the way I'm teaching you right now, right, it is only adding
1:15:03
up to my own what knowledge.
1:15:08
So I thought about it, right? Is what is a win-win. In fact, I can teach you, you might not
1:15:15
understand it, right? But what me what I'm adding more knowledge to me I know
1:15:21
what I lost right that g me hope every day that gave me more motivation every
1:15:28
day to keep learning because I don't want to come to the class imagine I don't have anything to say I cannot
1:15:33
explain I cannot teach once you go outside and say this is not good so that
1:15:38
motivation sp me up to what to want to give good results like now if anybody of you will say any
1:15:46
cere say about the academy. I'm very sure that you guys have positive things to say about the academy. Yes or no?
1:15:51
Yes. Because what we give you guys the result. I try my best every day to work to become the best.
1:15:58
That's mentorship. Money comes from there. And the money that comes from there to be sincere is very very low.
1:16:05
Right? So I'll say maybe what maybe 10% from here because this one you have to
1:16:11
pay for services, you have to pay for everything. He said hold up right and at
1:16:16
some point I feel like giving up or what I just like no I can't
1:16:22
right what every day I have to come to class sometimes go to different branches
1:16:27
teach you guys it was a fun it was passion but sometime you get tired of it right and at some point you feel like ah
1:16:34
cuz I feel like I make good money and I don't want to doing$3 300k a year you
1:16:39
know but I still I still keep doing it you still see me great time And I still try to come because of what the passion
1:16:48
now becomes the three signals.
1:16:58
I mean if there's anything that I would even rather do that will not stop is a
1:17:03
sit down because this one I'm on my own house on my floor. I can drop from
1:17:09
anywhere just like where you just copy my ch. All I need to make sure is what and give
1:17:14
it the result which I I definitely do of recently increase the price right and
1:17:21
people what they have to pay for it because what the result so I even tell
1:17:28
you I still [Music] this
1:17:34
because most people they rather just want to copy they don't really want to learn people that want to learn is
1:17:39
people that want to really be like like what you said you want to be like exact same thing as I do.
1:17:46
You understand? So this is another business for you. That is if you what
1:17:51
you know what you think. Like I said this is what life creates everything without these training skills training
1:17:57
result. Forget it. If you're doing any of this you're just planning people collecting money.
1:18:05
Yes sir. And you know what that if you do any of this like as of 2021 2022 there were all
1:18:12
these people that used to claim forest trading you give them money they say give you 20% every month right that is
1:18:20
not trading they're just using the money the name because they know where it is all right and to just count people money
1:18:26
that's it the fourth one broker partnership
1:18:36
broker partnership Brokers will look for you once you have a community
1:18:42
right once you start teaching your guys first people are looking you don't know who is looking at you do you understand
1:18:50
like that community the community we are right it started off with me and my
1:18:56
friend two people it has to something me and my friend and why did we create it
1:19:03
right because I saw my also has something like that it's that will be our friend so that we can be sharing. It
1:19:09
used to be a group so that we can be sharing ideas which we go back to as of
1:19:14
2017. You see how our chat used to look stupid. You see so many drawings on the
1:19:19
chart. We just upload it. So it's there and like I said you don't know who's
1:19:26
watching goes on right. I keep doing my thing. I keep people seeing result in
1:19:32
this. It makes them believe they keep joining. They keep joining that community. and they keep joining that
1:19:37
community. Brokers come to you because what you have what they want brokers the
1:19:42
people want they want them to use their platform you know
1:19:47
and that's it they pay you for that and they have different way they do
1:19:53
their partnership depend how big you are do you understand and it's just like like music too like all these music
1:19:59
stuff they have grand deal this right this is your own grand when it comes to trading people come to you promote
1:20:08
decent. It could be any like you're decent. You have the you have what it
1:20:14
takes. And these are like my major source of income. But like I said,
1:20:19
something of it is from Australian, right? Nothing can pay you as
1:20:25
you make $200, $200, $1,000 in how many months? 2 weeks. That's 1.6 million. Do
1:20:32
you know how many people you have to get to pay you 1.6 video in total. You know
1:20:38
how many promotion you have to do right? So now you see they force me the
1:20:44
customer so they force me I need to make video for promotion you know
1:20:50
so that people can can okay we are receiving student this is what pays you the most
1:20:57
so if you even have this if you're okay if you're comfortable if you're not a business you can stick this alone it
1:21:03
still librates you but you really want to be the best like I said want to be a billionaire want to do this you want to
1:21:10
go past you have to work follow the method. Not all billionaire does in
1:21:15
their industry, in their field, they do what? They do everything in that field. So you have to do everything. But now
1:21:22
this is like the major ways every every major traders they they make money,
1:21:30
right? So this is like uh good income,
1:21:36
good monthly income. That's if you can retain your subscriber, right? this
1:21:43
option for you. So that's it. That's just it, right? I'm
1:21:49
very personal. I always open up with you guys and I just show you guys how it is. Do you understand? So it's up to you.
1:21:55
You can make use of it, right? And just just know what you want. That's all.
1:22:01
It's not what you want. You'll get it. Any other question?
1:22:07
[Music] Thank you for achieving this. That's very
1:22:12
when you first came in the first class that you spoke about prop firms um aside
1:22:20
from prop firm because I have been following you for quite a while. One of the things that caused a breakthrough for you was the early investor deliver
1:22:27
that gave you some money. So how do you get networks like that? see results in
1:22:35
trust in their mind. So like I said without trading skills
1:22:40
without trading result it is what impossible. This guy is now he has a proof $200
1:22:47
something right if he comes to you right I'll tell you guys see my car this two
1:22:53
weeks won't you believe it if you in front of you won't you believe it
1:22:59
you're likely to what to give him money right now the only disadvantage is that
1:23:05
what past result does not guarantee what present future result so one thing I'll
1:23:10
tell you is what don't chase investors now and this Yes, because what is very dangerous you don't want to damage your
1:23:17
reputation. You see when people call me out online right now imagine I been
1:23:25
collecting money from people I ask someone give me your money he's not but because the guy doesn't have result he
1:23:31
cannot even show his face he does not have proof for it so I always tell people is he account
1:23:37
management right training for someone I used to do it before I don't
1:23:44
the best way open your training account yourself fund like $1,000 yourself. You
1:23:50
want to do account management and be copy my trade. I lose, you lose. I make money, you make money. If you not make
1:23:57
money or you want to bless me, bless me. But you pay for copy my trade. That's for you.
1:24:04
Money is right. And if you're looking for big capital, there are profit nowadays that will give you big more
1:24:10
capital than any investor, right? You why not take advantage of that? It's much better than what going through
1:24:17
night when you invest money they will look for you
1:24:26
I adise you not to do that so it is cuz I think that's one thing
1:24:32
[Music] cuz I think one thing that's helped me
1:24:39
is not doing that because I know some trailers that that damage when they when
1:24:44
they started like sometimes I look up to right even abroad that's when that slow
1:24:51
don't ever you have to be don't be greedy right if I was greedy when I
1:24:57
started there ways I would have made money cuz I thought about it you know when all the likes of NBA I don't know
1:25:05
if you guys know NBA forest you know you know those people collect 20%.
1:25:12
about I have small community
1:25:20
and be trading it. I can give them like maybe 20%. If I've done that, I'll show you what's what must have gone down in
1:25:27
history and maybe they looking for me today. [Music] But one of my my my mind the way I grew
1:25:35
up the greediness was was not here. First of all, I'm never a greedy person.
1:25:41
I'm always okay with what I have. I appreciate what I have and to do that. If you make $1,
1:25:47
I appreciate it. And you may know if they buy you small plates, want your
1:25:56
worth, whatever it is, because what you have for it,
1:26:01
right? You're different. There are so many people right that made money but their money is not legitimate but they
1:26:08
cannot come out to trade. Trading is different. Make your money
1:26:13
you live free. People respect you. There's a lot of places that training
1:26:19
has taken me to and when people see me like you must have seen
1:26:25
right I've met politicians. I met like celebrities, superstars, right? Which
1:26:31
I'm definitely I'm still growing and I'm still going to meet a lot more people and they all respect you.
1:26:39
So focus on what getting your own result. Don't be focusing on like the faster way is all about journey. Give
1:26:45
yourself now 25 years. Give yourself if you're consistent in the next 3 years
1:26:52
what will happen. Apart from me, you've seen other traders
1:26:57
2 years, 3 years, they're doing well. Yeah, I see. So, I I noticed something
1:27:03
on my demo account very fast. I'm doing very well. Like, so quick demo. I don't
1:27:08
know why. You know why? Because emotion is not
1:27:16
right. the way you realize
1:27:29
because it's big for so I know that before it gets to my stop loss at least you can go back but on those four
1:27:35
accounts it takes out the stop loss takes it out and then that's why you need to come with risk management right
1:27:41
whenever you're trading if you're going to take a buy this you need to know what your stop loss is what you're risking.
1:27:47
You calculate everything before and nothing will catch you in shock. Right? If it's 20 ps you're risking, know that
1:27:52
okay, it is this 20 $2 I'm risking nothing more and accept that the $2 is gone because trading is again you have
1:27:59
to accept that the loss is happening. Do you understand? And that's it.
1:28:06
So any question guys? Yeah,
1:28:11
I know. [Music]
1:28:17
As part of the African continent, um do you
1:28:23
still seek out knowledge to get better or is it the way you teach that? Uh
1:28:29
trust me, like trading knowledge is never ending. Anytime I take loss,
1:28:34
right? Cuz I don't like losing. I always go back to my training desk. I spent hours hours because me like I used to
1:28:42
have like backachche from sitting a lot. I spent hours yesterday I was home. I'll
1:28:49
tell you throughout yesterday I was on my trading desk. I mean you see I was active training
1:28:56
yesterday. I was on my trading desk throughout. So I really spend time on track before I
1:29:03
sleep. I check. I woke up in the midnight. I check in the morning. I check. Any small time I get, I check. So
1:29:12
like that's it. It's just a me and that's why you cannot expect nothing less, right? Sometime when I lose like I
1:29:21
feel bad like I just want to find reason why I really lost so that what I can I
1:29:26
can take it back on it and that's why you see me it's easy for me to grow an account. I say it's totally easy to grow
1:29:32
an account, right? But you just know how it works when you have a lot of expensive trade. You understand? And you
1:29:40
you're just starting. So take your time, explore, right? Make mistake, learn from
1:29:46
it. Cuz one of the major thing is making mistake and learning from that mistake,
1:29:52
not repeating it again. Because mistake in training are repetitions.
1:29:57
Which means that what if you make mistake now find again immediately you
1:30:02
make that mistake again. So you must make sure that repetition is not what is not happening you separate it. Do you
1:30:10
understand? So that's it.
1:30:15
Quick question Nabi. Does the news impact um forex as well? It impacts
1:30:20
everything. stock, crypto, everything but mostly yeah currencies because this
1:30:27
is like FOMC this is USD news right so anything has to do with USD it doesn't impact it
1:30:34
right so if you ask me basically what am I looking at for Euro USD uh I'm looking
1:30:41
out for a sale funny enough and I'll tell you why I'm looking out for a sale at the moment now the reason why I'm
1:30:46
looking out for a sale is this now the market has been uptrend all Right. And
1:30:52
uh the reason why I'm looking for a sell is because of the minor structure that's happening right now which you can see my
1:30:58
you can see my analysis. Can you see it? You can see my analysis. My analysis is clearly saying by at the moment. All
1:31:04
right. But this is where experience get to play out. Now I'll just go to the lower time frame uh quick like you can
1:31:11
said this is bullish trend and you can see this is where the buy is supposed to be coming from where the price is right
1:31:17
now. But I'm not going to be buying there. The reason why is this now why I'm not buying right now is because of
1:31:23
what price action is happening here on this Euro USD because of the price action that is
1:31:29
happening here. Now the price action there isn't giving us anything like a bullish structure or like a new uh price
1:31:37
correction. So that's the reason why I can say oh it's good for us to buy now cuz if you buy there it's like we're
1:31:42
gambling. So what do I rather do? What I would rather do in this case is I rather just want to spot the cell from the from
1:31:49
the top which is why I'm just going to follow the minor structure that is here. Now if you look at my minor structure
1:31:55
can we look at it together? Can you guys see? Yeah. Can you see where we have the
1:32:01
lower highs and we have series of lower lows minor you know minor that means you
1:32:06
can correct again easily. We have I
1:32:11
uh we have the high, we have the low, lower high, lower low, lower eye, lower low.
1:32:19
This is the last lower low, right? Which means that right now we have the eye which market was supposed to give us
1:32:25
higher low which we have right now. If market is actually supposed to turn bullish and we have the equal eye here.
1:32:31
So this equal eye, what's this saying? When you see equal eye in the market, what does that tell you guys?
1:32:37
like when you see double top a reversal a reversal like sell right so
1:32:42
that's telling us that right now on the minor structure time frame it is not ready for that buy so what I'm looking
1:32:48
for right now I'll look for opportunity for this price to just break low this support and if it breaks low this
1:32:54
support then I'll just jump on the sell right that give us a good confirmation
1:32:59
to sell at that point so this is it is either you get it from the 12 the price goes up or you get it
1:33:06
when the price uh break that low. I think it's much safer to get it when the price break the low because that already
1:33:12
gave you insight of what is happening already. So we can look at the sell for year. So one thing I might say is should
1:33:18
we set a sell stop? We have 2 minutes to the news, right? Actually we have 2 minutes to the news.
1:33:27
The news is in 1 minute, right? So should we set a sell stop or we should just wait for the news to come and
1:33:34
execute it? You already know how I trade. Most time I prefer to just wait and execute it myself since I can see
1:33:41
what's happening, right? Uh this news might be a massive because what the price has actually been consolidating
1:33:47
since. And for me, I'm going to be trading with uh with a 5K account. I want to see if I can flip this this
1:33:54
evening. And uh as a real account that's with access market, this broker you see
1:34:01
there. So let's see what we can get. And uh this 5k account if it's 0 USD if it's
1:34:08
0 USD I'm trading I can use up to 10 lot size. All right I use criminal lot size
1:34:13
on currency but if it's gold my lot size going to decrease crazily you know why.
1:34:20
All right now for gold as well as well funny enough gold too is going to sell for now but I really don't want to trade
1:34:26
gold at the moment because what gold has been ranging for a while right so this is what I expect on gold. You can see if
1:34:32
you go on my 1 hour time frame, we have 1 minute to the news, guys. Just stay ready. Get your M5 ready. Get your M5
1:34:38
ready and wait for me to set the instructions. Or you see that I take the 10 trade on my phone and you go ahead.
1:34:43
I'm just waiting for the price to push down to this level, then bounce back up,
1:34:48
right? So for gold, I'm looking out for a sell and I'm looking out for a sale as well. So let's see how many minutes to
1:34:55
the news. 3 seconds to the news, guys. 3 seconds. 1 seconds. and uh is up.
1:35:03
Oh, the news is up. All right. See, see us at the moment.
1:35:10
USD is going up. Don't forget our sell stop is right here. Waiting for it to come down. We cannot sell at the moment.
1:35:18
Let's look at gold. Let's look at gold. Go is going up, but
1:35:24
trust me, this is Don't Don't fall for it. Don't fall for it. It's going to come down. All right. Don't fall for it.
1:35:32
E US is really going up at the moment. But gold, don't don't dare to buy gold.
1:35:38
Do not dare to buy gold. If you buy gold on your own, I promise you, if you buy
1:35:45
gold, you're going to cry tonight at this point. You know, like all the signal I've been dropping, all the trade I've been taking is been buy on the go,
1:35:52
right? Because the trend is bullish and that's what we're supposed to be doing, right? But I told you guys right now
1:35:59
it's not ready for that buy.
1:36:04
So it's better your your patient [Music]
1:36:09
going on Euro USD. Euro USD has already sparked this stock
1:36:19
and uh still waiting if it breaks. So for now you know as you you see the way
1:36:24
the moment is going now if it is able to break above this high that means we have a new II right then you just wait for
1:36:31
the retest then that means it's going to go up but I believe this is just impulse move right this is not and for me I'll
1:36:38
be waiting for the for the uh for the breakout here so I think we should set a
1:36:44
sell stop. So what we're going to do now is uh if you want to trade this with me what I'm going to do is set a sell stop.
1:36:52
I'm going to write it out. Sell stop Euro USD
1:37:01
price at uh
1:37:09
let me just confirm the price.
1:37:17
You see this is a very low stop loss. So, if you've been looking to like take your crazy risk, this is it. Set stop at
1:37:24
uh 1.14.
1:37:30
1.14 814. What are you guys doing?
1:37:36
You took trade. Yeah. Let me see.
1:37:42
Oh, you see you see the you see the massive retrace, man. See see the way is coming down now. What did I tell you
1:37:48
guys? Don't fall for this. Let's look at God. Let's look at God. Let's see. Look what what's happening here. You see, I
1:37:55
told you do not buy. Experience. Experience.
1:38:01
No, I'm newer still, bro.
1:38:07
All right. So, I'm writing the trade out. What I'm going to do, the stop loss
1:38:14
is just about 20 pips. I miss trading currency. I can't remember the last time I trade currency 1.115
1:38:23
036 and reason why I'm trading this this Euro USD is because uh I was at the
1:38:29
trading floor today and uh I did this analysis with them at the trading floor today and that's why I get to follow up
1:38:36
with it and uh that's why I'm looking at trading right now. So the take profit
1:38:43
now the take profit is going to be short because this is not this is not a a a bearish trend like I said it's a minor
1:38:49
structure if we're looking at getting in the cell and because we're not getting in the cell from the top you have to be
1:38:54
very careful so the take profit is going to be really minor let me see
1:39:01
uh let me see the next support zone
1:39:07
yeah Yeah. Yeah. So, this is probably going to be the take profit.
1:39:17
So, let's say the take profit is 14 378.4
1:39:25
378. All right. So, this this is a trade in case you want to copy. This is what I'm
1:39:31
looking at doing. Set stop. You can screenshot that and uh you can follow up with it. So that's what I'm going to
1:39:37
set. Watch me do that now. Like you see see the massive retracement.
1:39:44
All right. See see the massive retracement. See the way it went down. But right now don't sell yet. Don't sell
1:39:50
yet. It's better to wait for confirmation than the than the was it called than just jumping
1:39:59
into the impulse move. Um,
1:40:07
so stop 14814
1:40:13
814.
1:40:18
Like I said, 10 lot. I'm just risking 20 two 2K. I'm risking $2,000 on each
1:40:25
position. So, I think that's fair. 1 15 03 6
1:40:32
take profit 1 4 3 7 8
1:40:42
So let's see let's see let's see let's see all right I was going to I was going
1:40:47
to show you guys some withdrawal I posted I think I only posted it on my snap and I made a comment that uh your
1:40:54
mind wouldn't take it you are taking the trade
1:41:03
He's only camera still taking a
1:41:09
very active is really active.
1:41:15
All right. So like this this trade I think that's perfect, right? Even if it it if it wouldn't come to our entry,
1:41:22
you're safe. Nothing's going to happen. And if it comes to our entry, that means the trade is fully cooked. And uh expect
1:41:28
good jaw is coming. Have you guys said the trade?
1:41:39
Have you guys said the trade? Yeah, I'm still trying to work out my
1:41:45
lot size cuz I'm trying to use your account is 11K, right, Larry?
1:41:51
Yeah, but I'm only going to risk 1,000 this time. So, withdraw my money. So, I'm just going to use five on this trip.
1:41:59
Five. Yeah, that's that's $1,000. [Music]
1:42:05
How about you? Stuff. Same. I'm I'm using four four
1:42:12
lot. Okay. Great. Great. Yeah. So, let's see. Just said stop. Nothing much. Let's go back to go and see what's happening
1:42:17
on gold. All right. Because I think I've seen the possibility that there for gold. Gold will surely drop, right? Gold
1:42:24
is not going anywhere up. This is like maximum it will go for now. But gold
1:42:31
will still buy at the end of the day. So let me just share the full analysis. I think I shared this analysis on our telegram page. Let me go there by quick.
1:42:40
