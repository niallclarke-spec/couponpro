Context:
This codebase currently runs in production for EntryLab (single-tenant).
A multi-tenant foundation exists, but true tenant resolution is NOT yet implemented.

What already exists (DO NOT CHANGE):
- tenants, tenant_users, tenant_integrations tables
- tenant_id columns on core tables (default 'entrylab')
- resolve_credentials() routes EntryLab to env vars
- /api/tenant/setup-status and /api/tenant/integrations endpoints
- Route guards for EntryLab-only routes and Forex SaaS routes
- Admin password auth continues to work and must remain unchanged

Important constraint:
EntryLab behavior must remain 100% unchanged.
No tenant should ever be inferred from request data.
No code should be written in this phase.

Goal of this PLAN:
Design Phase 2A — **real tenant resolution using Clerk authentication**, without implementing it yet.

Specifically, I want you to:

1) **Analyze the current auth flow**
   - Where admin auth is validated
   - Where Clerk auth would need to be introduced
   - How requests currently reach apply_route_checks()

2) **Propose a safe tenant resolution strategy**
   - How clerk_user_id should be extracted from a verified Clerk JWT
   - Where tenant lookup against tenant_users should occur
   - How tenant_id should be attached to the request lifecycle

3) **Define exact failure behavior**
   - What happens if a Clerk-authenticated user has no tenant mapping
   - What HTTP status and JSON body should be returned
   - Ensure admin auth always forces tenant_id = 'entrylab'

4) **List exact files that would change**
   - middleware files
   - any new helper modules
   - ZERO changes to business logic handlers

5) **Explicitly call out what is NOT included**
   - No auto-tenant creation
   - No UI changes
   - No tenant-aware query refactors
   - No secrets encryption changes

6) **Provide a step-by-step build plan**
   - In ordered steps
   - With notes on risk and rollback safety
   - With verification steps for each stage

Output format required:
- Section A: Current auth flow summary
- Section B: Proposed tenant resolution flow
- Section C: Failure & edge-case handling
- Section D: Files to be modified (with reasons)
- Section E: Step-by-step build plan
- Section F: Explicit non-goals

Do NOT implement anything.
Do NOT assume anything not proven in the codebase.
Do NOT skip details.
