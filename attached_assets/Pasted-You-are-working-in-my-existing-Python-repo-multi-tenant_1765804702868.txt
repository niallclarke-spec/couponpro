You are working in my existing Python repo (multi-tenant forex scheduler). Do NOT refactor broadly. Make the smallest, safest fixes to address the two runtime issues shown in my terminal output.

CONTEXT / CURRENT FAILURES
1) When I run with a placeholder DATABASE_URL like:
   export DATABASE_URL="postgres://USER:PASS@HOST:5432/DBNAME"
   Postgres fails DNS with:
   could not translate host name "HOST" to address
   This is expected because HOST is not real, but our tooling behavior should be clearer and should never mislead us into thinking smoke tests passed when DB is unreachable.

2) When I run:
   python forex_scheduler.py --once --tenant entrylab
   I get:
   TypeError: get_daily_pnl() missing 1 required positional argument: 'tenant_id'
   This happens inside strategies/aggressive.py (check_guardrails -> get_daily_pnl()).
   Tenant hardening made tenant_id required, so this is a bug.

GOALS
A) Fix the missing tenant_id path so scheduler runs end-to-end for a real tenant.
B) Improve DB availability behavior so the system clearly differentiates:
   - DATABASE_URL not set
   - DATABASE_URL set but unreachable (DNS/network/auth failure)
   and so smoke/scheduler exit codes are correct and not confusing.

REQUIREMENTS
1) Fix tenant_id propagation in ALL strategy guardrail paths:
   - Search for get_daily_pnl( and any other db calls recently changed to require tenant_id (e.g. get_last_completed_signal, get_forex_signals, etc.)
   - Ensure every call includes tenant_id from the runtime/engine/scheduler context.
   - If a strategy method doesn’t have tenant_id available, add it as a parameter or store it on the strategy instance when constructed (preferred: pass via constructor).
   - Keep changes minimal.

2) Ensure the scheduler constructs strategies with tenant context:
   - Verify the scheduler/runner/runtime creates the strategy objects with tenant_id available.
   - Do NOT reintroduce global singletons.
   - Maintain current TenantRuntime model.

3) Improve DB connection error clarity + exit behavior:
   - In smoke_tenant_isolation.py:
     * If DATABASE_URL is missing: keep current behavior (local exits 0 with SKIPPED message, CI exits 1).
     * If DATABASE_URL is set but DB init fails (DNS/auth/etc): print a clear message like:
       "DATABASE_URL is set but database connection failed (dns/auth/network)."
       Keep local exit code 0 only if the script is explicitly designed to skip locally; otherwise follow current policy. Do NOT claim "PASSED" when DB is unreachable.
   - In forex_scheduler.py:
     * If DATABASE_URL is set but db pool initialization fails, exit non-zero and print a clear single-line summary at the end (don’t spam stack traces unless DEBUG is enabled).
     * Avoid running strategy logic if db pool can’t initialize.

4) Add/Update tests:
   - Add a unit test proving strategies call get_daily_pnl with tenant_id.
   - Add a unit test verifying scheduler refuses to run if DB pool init fails (can be mocked).
   - Ensure pytest -q still passes (expect ~116 passed, a few skipped for DB/RLS).

WHAT TO CHANGE (LIKELY FILES)
- strategies/aggressive.py (and any other strategies that call db functions without tenant_id)
- strategies/conservative.py and strategies/raja_banks.py (audit for same pattern)
- scheduler/runner.py or forex_scheduler.py (where strategy objects are created and tenant is passed)
- db.py only if absolutely required for error message clarity (avoid broad edits)
- scripts/smoke_tenant_isolation.py (connection failure messaging / exit policy)

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (RUN THESE COMMANDS)
1) python scripts/tenant_audit.py  -> must PASS
2) pytest -q                       -> must PASS (skips ok)
3) Cold import must work:
   python - << 'EOF'
   import forex_scheduler, scheduler.runner, core.runtime
   print("Cold import OK")
   EOF
4) With real DB secrets set (do NOT use HOST placeholder), scheduler must run without tenant_id TypeError:
   export TENANT_ID=entrylab
   python forex_scheduler.py --once --tenant entrylab

IMPORTANT
- Keep changes minimal and targeted.
- Do not remove tenant_id requirements from db functions.
- Do not change business logic or signal behavior; only fix tenant propagation + DB init handling.
- After changes, show me:
  (a) which files changed
  (b) the exact ripgrep results for calls you fixed
  (c) the terminal outputs for the acceptance commands above
