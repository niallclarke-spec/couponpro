Generate internal technical documentation for this project.

Audience:
- A senior developer joining the project
- Assumes Python knowledge, but no prior knowledge of this codebase

Goals:
- Explain how the system is structured today (not future plans)
- Explain startup flow, routing, workers, and integrations
- Clearly document where configuration and secrets live
- Document what is single-tenant today and what is NOT tenant-aware yet
- No marketing language, no assumptions about future features

Required sections:

1. High-Level Overview
   - What this application does (coupon system, forex signals, Telegram bots, Stripe billing)
   - Single-process architecture
   - Custom http.server-based backend

2. Startup & Lifecycle
   - server.py as entrypoint
   - create_app_context() vs start_app()
   - What runs at import time vs runtime
   - Scheduler startup guarantees (exactly one scheduler)

3. Routing & Request Flow
   - api/routes.py
   - api/middleware.py
   - How requests are matched, gated (auth/db), and dispatched
   - Static file serving vs API routing

4. Domain Modules
   - domains/subscriptions
   - domains/coupons
   - domains/forex
   - What logic lives in handlers vs what still lives elsewhere

5. Integrations
   - Stripe (integrations/stripe)
   - Telegram bots + webhooks (integrations/telegram)
   - OpenAI client (integrations/openai)
   - Market data (Twelve Data)

6. Workers & Background Jobs
   - workers/scheduler
   - workers/price_monitor
   - workers/milestone_tracker
   - How workers are started and why they are wrapped

7. Configuration & Secrets
   - core/config.py
   - Environment variables used
   - Difference between platform-wide config vs runtime state
   - Where API keys are loaded (but not their values)

8. Current Limitations
   - Single-tenant design
   - Global bots, scheduler, and shared DB
   - No per-tenant isolation yet

9. Safety Invariants
   - Importing server.py must not start side effects
   - Webhooks only registered in bootstrap
   - Scheduler must start exactly once
   - Middleware is the only auth/db gate

10. Glossary
   - Key terms used in the codebase (handler, domain, worker, middleware, integration)

Tone:
- Precise, technical, honest
- No future promises unless explicitly labeled as “Not yet implemented”
