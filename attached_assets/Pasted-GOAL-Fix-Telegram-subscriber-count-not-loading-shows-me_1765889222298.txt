GOAL: Fix Telegram subscriber count not loading (shows “-- members”) after refactor. This is caused by authenticated requests to GET /api/telegram-channel-stats returning 401 in real use. Implement a definitive fix and add regression tests that would have failed before.

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS
- DO NOT add code to server.py beyond thin wrapper methods.
- Implement changes in the appropriate modules (auth/, api/, domains/, assets/js/) with a clean file structure.
- Preserve existing security: X-Clerk-User-Email header must NEVER authenticate.
- Keep multi-tenant/host rules intact.

WHAT TO FIX (REQUIRED)
1) Frontend: ensure authenticated API calls send cookies
   - Locate the shared authedFetch helper (admin.html or assets/js shared module, likely assets/js/journeys.js or another shared JS util).
   - Ensure ALL authenticated fetches include: credentials: "include"
   - Ensure it continues to send Authorization: Bearer <jwt> when present, BUT cookies must still be included because admin_session is a valid fallback.
   - Confirm the exact call in admin UI that loads Telegram stats (admin.html references /api/telegram-channel-stats). Make sure it uses the fixed authedFetch.

2) Backend: ensure cookie-based auth works for /api/telegram-channel-stats and /api/auth/debug
   - /api/telegram-channel-stats has auth_required=True. It must accept:
     a) Authorization: Bearer (Clerk JWT) when valid
     b) admin_session cookie (HMAC signed) when valid
     c) __session cookie (Clerk session) if that’s supported in your auth layer
   - Ensure /api/check-auth returns authenticated:true when a valid admin_session cookie is present.
   - Ensure /api/auth/debug (admin-only) returns 200 for authenticated admin users using either Bearer JWT OR admin_session cookie.

3) Add real regression tests that would have caught this
   Add tests that simulate BOTH auth modes and prove these endpoints return 200:
   - A) With valid admin_session cookie:
       - GET /api/check-auth -> authenticated true
       - GET /api/telegram-channel-stats -> not 401 (200 OR 503/502 depending on config, but MUST pass auth)
       - GET /api/auth/debug -> 200
   - B) With Bearer token auth (mock/patch token verification in tests):
       - Same endpoints should pass.
   - C) Negative control:
       - X-Clerk-User-Email alone must still fail (401).

   Implementation guidance:
   - Patch/monkeypatch the admin cookie verification function to return a user object in tests (don’t require real secrets).
   - Patch Clerk JWT verification similarly.
   - Do NOT rely on live network or real Telegram API in tests; mock the Telegram call in domains/subscriptions/handlers.py so the test focuses on AUTH, not Telegram availability.
   - Tests should live in tests/ (e.g., tests/test_telegram_stats_auth.py) and must fail on the current broken behavior and pass after fixes.

DELIVERABLES
- Minimal code changes in correct modules (not server.py).
- Updated authedFetch to include credentials.
- Updated backend auth handling (if needed) so cookie auth is honored.
- New tests verifying cookie auth + bearer auth + negative controls.
- Run pytest -q and ensure all tests pass.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- In the actual admin dashboard UI, Telegram subscriber count displays real numbers (or a meaningful configured error), not “-- members”.
- curl without auth returns 401 (unchanged).
- browser session (cookie) works without requiring Bearer JWT.
- test suite includes coverage that would have caught this exact regression.
