You are working on my existing project. Do NOT change backend auth logic unless explicitly required. This task is FRONTEND-FIRST and UI/UX focused.

GOAL
Fix Clerk authentication UI issues and modernise the login/logout experience.

CURRENT PROBLEMS TO FIX
1) When a user is already logged in, the sidebar STILL shows a “Login with Google” button. This must NEVER happen.
2) Instead of a login button when authenticated, show a modern user avatar + dropdown with Logout.
3) On the /login page, TWO login UIs are visible (old widget behind Clerk modal). The Clerk modal is also off-centre.
4) The login screen looks broken and unpolished. It must look production-ready.

RULES
- Keep Clerk as the single source of authentication.
- Do NOT introduce new frameworks or libraries.
- Do NOT duplicate Clerk mounts.
- Do NOT rely on localStorage/sessionStorage alone to decide auth state.
- Use the server as the source of truth via existing auth endpoints.
- Make minimal, clean changes limited to admin.html and login.html (server.py only if absolutely necessary for user info).

TASKS TO IMPLEMENT

A) ADMIN DASHBOARD AUTH UI (admin.html)
- Remove the persistent “Login with Google” button logic.
- Replace it with this behavior:
  - If NOT authenticated → show a single “Sign in” button.
  - If authenticated → show a compact user avatar chip (circle avatar + email) with a dropdown.
- The dropdown must contain:
  - Logout
- Avatar behavior:
  - If Clerk provides an image URL, use it.
  - Otherwise generate a fallback avatar (first letter of email in a circle).
- Clicking Logout must:
  - Call existing logout logic.
  - Clear Clerk session.
  - Return UI to logged-out state immediately.

AUTH STATE LOGIC
- On page load and on window focus:
  - Call the existing auth check endpoint.
  - If 200 → authenticated UI.
  - If 401/403 → logged-out UI.
- UI state must always reflect server auth state.
- Never show Login and Logout at the same time.

UI REQUIREMENTS
- Modern, minimal, dark-theme friendly.
- Avatar chip aligned with sidebar.
- Subtle hover states.
- Dropdown closes on outside click.

B) LOGIN PAGE CLEANUP (login.html)
- Remove or fully hide ANY legacy login card or widget.
- Only ONE Clerk sign-in component must exist.
- Clerk must mount ONCE only (guard against double mounting).
- The Clerk sign-in UI must be:
  - Perfectly centered vertically and horizontally.
  - Contained in a clean layout (no overlapping background widgets).
- Add a global guard flag to prevent duplicate Clerk mounting.
- Ensure correct Clerk CDN usage and window.Clerk initialization.

C) VISUAL POLISH
- Fix contrast issues (no unreadable text).
- Ensure buttons, text, and spacing look production-ready.
- No “Development mode” or debug artifacts should be styled prominently (this is acceptable to show in dev, but layout must not break).

DELIVERABLES
- Update admin.html with:
  - Proper auth-driven UI state
  - Avatar + dropdown Logout
- Update login.html with:
  - Single, centered Clerk sign-in
  - No duplicate widgets
- Briefly comment changes in code where auth UI is decided.

DO NOT:
- Add new auth systems.
- Reintroduce password login.
- Leave TODOs unfinished.
- Leave duplicate buttons visible.

EXPECTED RESULT
- Logged-in admin NEVER sees “Login with Google”.
- Logged-in admin sees avatar + Logout.
- Logged-out users see only Sign in.
- Login page shows ONE clean Clerk modal, centered.
- UI looks clean, modern, and intentional.

Proceed to implement now.
