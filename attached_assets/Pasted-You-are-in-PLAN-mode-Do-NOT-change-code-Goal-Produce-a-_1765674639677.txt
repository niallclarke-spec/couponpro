You are in PLAN mode. Do NOT change code.

Goal: Produce a production deployment + verification runbook for DigitalOcean that:
- Confirms multi-tenant migrations are applied
- Confirms EntryLab remains env-credentialed and cannot be overridden
- Confirms new tenant endpoints are reachable but protected
- Confirms Stripe + multipart endpoints behave as expected
- Detects duplicate scheduler startups (if any) and proves whether it’s real or just dev restarts

Deliverable: A step-by-step runbook with exact commands and expected outputs.

Include these sections:

1) Pre-deploy checklist (DO App + DO DB)
- Required env vars (including Clerk publishable + secret)
- Which secrets MUST be encrypted/stored only as env vars (and never committed)
- Any “do not forget” config: webhook URLs, allowed origins, ports, health checks

2) Database verification (DO console SQL)
Provide exact SQL queries that validate:
- tenants table exists and entrylab seeded
- tenant_id columns exist on the 9 tables and have default 'entrylab'
- processed_webhook_events has (tenant_id, event_id, event_source, processed_at) and unique constraint
- processed_webhook_events_old still exists as rollback
- Index existence checks where relevant

3) HTTP smoke tests (unauth and auth)
Provide curl commands + expected status codes/body for:
- GET /api/check-auth (unauth)
- GET /api/tenant/setup-status (unauth -> 401, auth -> 200)
- POST /api/tenant/integrations (auth) and confirm it blocks tenant_id==entrylab
- POST /api/stripe/webhook with {} (should return 200 {"received": true})
- GET /api/telegram/revenue-metrics (auth required)
- POST /api/upload-template and /api/upload-overlay (auth required)
Include both negative (should 401/403) and positive tests.

4) Scheduler single-start verification (PROD)
Explain how to confirm only one scheduler instance is running in production:
- What log lines to look for
- How to distinguish a real double-start from a platform restart
- If multiple workers are enabled, explain implications and recommended safe config

5) Rollback plan
- What to do if deployment fails
- How to revert webhook table swap using processed_webhook_events_old
- How to disable new tenant guards temporarily (without removing code), if needed

Constraints:
- Do not ask me questions.
- Use concrete commands and expected outputs.
- Keep it concise and executable.
