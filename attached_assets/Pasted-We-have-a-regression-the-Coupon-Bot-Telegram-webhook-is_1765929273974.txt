We have a regression: the Coupon Bot Telegram webhook is broken.

Evidence:
- Logs show repeated: `POST /api/telegram-webhook ... 403` followed by `[AUTH] No cookie header found`
- Telegram will NEVER send cookies, so this endpoint must not go through auth middleware.
- This endpoint must remain isolated from the FX Signals “Connections/BotCredentialResolver” system. Coupon bot stays hard-coded (Config.get_telegram_bot_token / env var) and OUT OF SCOPE for tenant connections.

NON-NEGOTIABLE ARCHITECTURE:
- DO NOT add business logic to server.py. Only thin route registration / handler delegation allowed.
- Fix must live in the correct middleware/routing layer (api/middleware.py / api/dispatch.py / api/routes.py) and in the coupon webhook handler module if needed.

TASK:
1) Ensure `/api/telegram-webhook` is fully AUTH-EXEMPT
   - It must bypass ALL auth checks (cookie/JWT/Clerk/admin_session).
   - It must not require Host headers.
   - It must not require tenant selection.
   - It must never return 401/403 due to auth.

2) Confirm `/api/forex-telegram-webhook` remains auth-exempt too (if it already is).

3) Add a regression test that would have caught this:
   - Test: POST /api/telegram-webhook with a minimal JSON body (or `{}`) returns 200 (or at least not 401/403).
   - The test must NOT set cookies or Authorization headers.
   - If the handler requires a token/config to do real work, it should still return 200 with a JSON like `{"status":"ignored"}` or `{"status":"ok"}` rather than 403.

4) Add a second regression test to ensure auth still works elsewhere:
   - Example: GET /api/telegram-channel-stats without auth returns 401 (or whatever is expected).

IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:
- In api/middleware.py (or wherever auth is enforced), make the exemption check run BEFORE auth logic.
- The exemption should match exact paths (`/api/telegram-webhook`, `/api/forex-telegram-webhook`) and also tolerate trailing slash if relevant.
- If you have centralized route metadata (Route(auth_required=...)), ensure webhook routes are explicitly marked auth_required=False.
- Do not “fix” by adding fake cookies, weakening global auth, or moving webhook logic into server.py.

DELIVERABLE:
- Code changes that restore `/api/telegram-webhook` to return 200 without cookies.
- New tests passing.
- Confirm via curl: `curl -i -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/telegram-webhook -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}'` returns HTTP 200 (not 401/403).
