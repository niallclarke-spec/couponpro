You are working inside an existing Python codebase that has already undergone extensive multi-tenant architecture hardening.

Your task is NOT to introduce new features. Your task is to:
1) Validate
2) Summarise
3) Confirm production-readiness
4) Produce a clean final sign-off summary suitable for a PR / Jira ticket / deployment note

Context (already implemented — do NOT redo):

ARCHITECTURE HARDENING
- Error boundary added with run_guarded() / run_guarded_async()
- get_runtime() always returns a fresh TenantRuntime (no globals, no caching)
- Scheduler uses TenantRuntime (no global singletons)
- Cold imports do not initialize DB pools
- Strategy imports work from both strategies/ and bots/strategies/
- Deterministic SHA256-based sharding implemented
- RLS enforcement available behind ENABLE_RLS=1
- tenant_audit.py enforces tenant_id on UPDATE/DELETE queries

DB LAYER FIXES
- get_forex_config() returns {} instead of None and always includes tenant_id
- get_bot_config() returns {} instead of None and always includes tenant_id
- create_forex_signal default status fixed from 'draft' → 'pending'

SCHEMA-TOLERANT SHARDING (LATEST FIX)
- Added _column_exists(schema, table, column)
- Added _build_forex_config_tenants_query() with ordered fallback rules:
  Rule 1: enabled
  Rule 2: is_enabled
  Rule 3: status IN ('active','enabled','on')
  Rule 4: active
  Rule 5: no enable column → return all tenant_id values
- get_active_tenants() uses the query builder and falls back to forex_signals if no config rows exist
- Added structured logging indicating which rule is used
- Scheduler no longer crashes when DB schema differs across environments

TOOLS & TESTS ADDED
- scripts/inspect_table_columns.py (DB schema inspection)
- tests/test_active_tenants_query_builder.py (unit tests for all 5 rules)
- Existing test suite expanded to cover architecture guarantees

ACCEPTANCE RESULTS (ALREADY VERIFIED)
- tenant_audit.py → PASSED (532 SQL blocks)
- pytest → 116 passed, 4 skipped
- smoke_tenant_isolation.py → PASSED
- Cold import → OK (no DB init)
- Sharded scheduler runs without schema errors
- Real DB verified (DNS, TCP, Postgres auth confirmed)

WHAT YOU SHOULD DO NOW:
1) Produce a concise FINAL SUMMARY confirming the system is production-ready
2) Explicitly state that the original failure ("column enabled does not exist") is resolved
3) Confirm that schema differences are now safely handled at runtime
4) Do NOT suggest further refactors or changes
5) Do NOT output code
6) Output should be suitable for:
   - PR description
   - Jira completion comment
   - Deployment handoff note

Tone:
- Calm
- Technical
- Confident
- No hype
- No new work suggested

End with a clear statement that the scheduler and multi-tenant system are safe to deploy.
