If you clicked this video… you've probably tried  scalping, day trading, or even swinging gold! 
0:06
And nothing worked consistently… until now! This strategy is different - and I'll prove it!  
0:13
So gold prices fool traders every day! This  particular market requires perfect timing! 
0:20
Most traders always seem to  be too early or too late!  
0:24
Well, this guide combines multiple  technical factors - trendline breaks,  
0:30
resistance-support flips, and retests -  into high-probability trade opportunities. 
0:36
So let's break down the key components and  explore why this approach can be effective,  
0:42
from a supply and demand perspective. This chart shows an upward trendline  
The Significance of a Trendline Break
0:48
that's been in place for some time. This trendline represents a series of higher lows,  
0:54
indicating consistent buying pressure. However, the strategy focuses on the moment  
1:00
when this trendline is broken to the downside. A trendline break is significant. 
1:06
It suggests that buyers are no longer able to  maintain the previous rate of price increase. 
1:12
When price breaks below the trendline,  
1:15
it often indicates that selling pressure  is starting to overcome buying pressure.  
The Retest of the Broken Trendline
1:20
After the initial break, price often returns  to the underside of the trendline. This retest  
1:26
serves several purposes. It confirms the validity  
1:30
of the break. If the trendline now acts as  resistance, it strengthens the bearish case. 
1:36
Also, it provides a more favorable entry point  for short trades, with a tighter stop loss. 
1:43
And it often traps late buyers who see  the pullback as a buying opportunity,  
1:49
not realizing the trend has changed. From a supply and demand perspective,  
1:54
the area just above the broken  trendline becomes a zone of supply. 
1:59
Sellers who missed the initial move down are often  eager to enter short positions at this level,  
2:06
creating additional selling pressure. The strategy also incorporates a key  
Support and Resistance Flip
2:11
support level that has now flipped to resistance. This concept is powerful because it demonstrates  
2:17
a clear shift in market psychology. Previously, this level acted as support,  
2:23
meaning buyers were consistently willing  to step in and purchase at this price. 
2:29
This area now acts as resistance. And  this indicates that previous buyers at  
2:35
this level are now looking to exit their  positions, creating selling pressure. 
2:41
New sellers view this level as an  opportunity to enter short positions. 
2:46
And the overall market sentiment has  shifted from bullish to bearish.  
The Confluence of Bearish Signals
2:51
The power of this strategy lies in the  confluence of multiple bearish signals: 
2:56
• the broken upward trendline • the successful retest of the broken trendline 
3:00
• and the previous support  now acting as resistance 
3:05
When these factors align, it creates a  high-probability setup for a short trade. 
3:11
The confluence of signals increases the  likelihood that the bearish move will continue,  
3:16
because it represents a significant shift  in market dynamics and psychology.  
Why the Retest Trade is Effective
3:22
The retest trade is effective for several reasons: Markets often have a "memory" of significant price  
3:29
levels. When price returns to a previously  important level (like a broken trendline or  
3:35
a broken support), it often reacts strongly. Also, many traders who missed the initial  
3:42
uptrend see the pullback to the trendline as  a "second chance" to enter long positions. 
3:49
When price fails to move higher, these traders are  forced to exit, adding to the selling pressure. 
3:56
At the same time, traders looking for  short entries often wait for a retest  
4:02
of a broken level. This allows them  to enter with a tighter stop loss. 
4:07
And the retest confirms that the broken  level is now acting as resistance.  
4:13
Understanding why buyers become  trapped above this level is key. 
Understanding Trapped Buyers
4:18
As I said, some buyers enter long positions  when price briefly moves above the previous  
4:24
support (now resistance) level,  thinking the uptrend is resuming. 
4:27
Other traders see the pullback to the  trendline as a buying opportunity,  
4:32
not realizing the trend has changed. As price fails to move higher and  
4:37
instead drops below the entry points of these  trapped buyers, their stop losses are triggered,  
4:44
adding to the selling pressure. And the realization that the  
4:48
trend has changed can cause panic selling  among those who were previously bullish.  
Supply and Demand Dynamics in a Sell Setup
4:54
From a supply and demand  viewpoint, this setup represents  
4:58
a significant shift in the balance of power: We clearly have an Exhaustion of Demand. The  
5:04
break of the upward trendline implies that buying  pressure (the demand) is no longer strong enough  
5:10
to maintain the previous rate of price increase. We also have an increase in Supply: The area above  
5:17
the broken trendline and the flipped support  level becomes a zone of increased supply. 
5:23
Sellers are more willing to enter or  add to short positions at these levels. 
5:29
And this creates an Imbalance: the  confluence of signals creates a  
5:34
situation where supply significantly outweighs  demand, leading to downward price movement.
5:41
So this trading strategy combines  multiple technical analysis concepts. 
5:46
It relies on a shift in market dynamics  and psychology, as represented by the  
5:52
broken trendline and flipped support level. And the power of this method lies in its  
5:57
ability to identify situations where  supply is likely to overwhelm demand,  
6:02
leading to downward price movement. Now let’s look at a buy signal. 
Introduction to the Buy Signal Strategy
6:08
This combines two key breakouts - a diagonal  trendline break and a horizontal resistance break. 
6:15
This dual breakout setup can signal a strong  shift in market dynamics, often leading to  
6:21
significant upward price movement. Let's start with the trendline break. 
The Trendline Break in a Downtrend
6:26
In a downtrend, price makes lower  highs and lower lows. And we draw  
6:31
a trendline connecting these lower highs. When price finally breaks above this trendline,  
6:38
it's a sign that selling  pressure may be weakening. 
6:42
This break is step one of our “buy” signal. But a break alone isn't enough. 
6:47
After the initial break, price  often pulls back to the trendline. 
6:52
This retest is crucial. If the  old resistance (the trendline)  
6:57
now acts as support, it confirms the breakout. It shows that market psychology has shifted.  
The Horizontal Breakout
7:05
Then, there’s the horizontal breakout. During a  downtrend, certain price levels act as resistance. 
7:12
When price not only breaks the downward trendline,  but also pushes above one of these horizontal  
7:18
resistance levels, it's a strong signal. The power of this breakout  
7:23
comes from its dual nature. You're not just seeing one type  
7:26
of breakout, but two. The diagonal breakout (the  trendline) shows a change in the overall trend. 
7:34
The horizontal breakout shows that  a specific price level, which had  
7:38
been holding price down, has now been overcome. From a supply and demand perspective, this setup  
Supply and Demand in a Buy Setup
7:45
is fascinating. The downtrend represents  a period where supply outweighs demand. 
7:52
Sellers are in control, pushing price lower. The trendline break suggests that this balance  
7:58
is shifting. So demand is  starting to overcome supply. 
8:02
The retest of the trendline and the  previous resistance is a key moment. 
8:07
It's where old sellers (the supply)  may try to reassert control. 
8:13
If they fail – so if price bounces off the  old trendline - it shows that new buyers  
8:19
(the demand) are now strong enough  to absorb this selling pressure.  
8:23
The break of horizontal  resistance adds another layer. 
8:27
These resistance levels are prices where  supply previously overwhelmed demand. 
8:33
Breaking through shows that  demand has not just increased,  
8:36
but increased enough to absorb all the supply  at that price level, and push even higher .  
The Psychology of a Buy Setup and Trapped Sellers
8:44
It's all about market psychology. During the  downtrend, traders get used to selling at  
8:50
certain levels. When price breaks higher,  many don't believe the move at first. 
8:56
They see the pullback to the  trendline as a chance to short again. 
9:00
But if price bounces off the trendline,  these shorts are now trapped. Their  
9:05
stop-losses become fuel for the next move up. The same happens with the horizontal breakout.  
9:12
Traders who've seen price turn down from this  level before may try to short there again. 
9:19
If price pushes through, their  stops add buying pressure. 
9:23
This brings us to trapped sellers. In the original downtrend, selling at the  
9:29
trendline or at resistance levels was profitable. As price breaks higher, these sellers  
9:35
start to doubt their positions. Each push higher puts more pressure  
9:40
on them. Eventually, they have to buy, to cover  their shorts, adding even more upward pressure. 
9:48
The confluence of these signals - trendline break,  successful retest, and resistance-to-support flip,  
9:55
creates a powerful buy setup. Volume often plays a key role here too. 
The Role of Volume in Confirming Signals
10:01
Look for higher than average  volume on the initial breaks. 
10:06
This shows strong buying pressure. Then, look for lower volume on the retest. 
10:12
This suggests that sellers aren't  putting up much of a fight anymore .  
Using Candlestick Patterns for Extra Confirmation
10:16
Candlestick patterns can add extra confirmation. A strong bullish candle on the breakout,  
10:23
followed by small, indecisive candles  on the retest, can be a good sign. 
10:29
It shows strong buying on the break and a  lack of selling pressure on the pullback.  
10:36
This strategy works well because it  aligns with how markets often move. 
10:41
Trends don't reverse in an instant.  There's usually a period of struggle as  
10:46
buyers and sellers battle for control. This setup captures that battle and  
10:52
signals when buyers are winning. It's also a versatile strategy. 
Versatility of the Strategy Across Timeframes
10:57
You can use it on any timeframe,  from intraday to daily charts. 
11:02
The longer the timeframe, often  the more significant the signal. 
Clear Entry and Stop Loss Levels
11:06
One strength of this strategy is that it  gives clear entry and stop loss levels. 
11:12
You can enter on at the confluence zone,  after the retest, with a stop loss below it.  
11:19
Another chart! First, you identify a  clear downtrend and draw your trendline. 
Step-by-Step Guide to a Buy Trade
11:26
You then mark the key  horizontal resistance levels. 
11:29
Then wait for a break of both the trendline  and a significant resistance level.  
11:35
After that, you look for a pullback to  retest the broken trendline and the previous  
11:41
resistance. This is the confluence zone. If price bounces off this retest level,  
11:47
consider entering a long position. You place your stop loss just  
11:52
below the retest low. And you may taking partial  
11:56
profits at the next major resistance level,  while also moving your stop to breakeven.  
12:02
This strategy is about catching  a potential momentum change. 
12:06
And the real profit potential comes if you've  truly caught the start of a new uptrend. 
12:12
In that case, after your entry, you might see  price making a series of higher highs and higher  
12:18
lows, the opposite of the previous downtrend. In essence, this method is about spotting  
12:24
the shift from a seller-dominated  market, to a buyer-dominated one. 
12:30
The trendline break shows the first  crack in the sellers' control. 
12:34
The break of horizontal resistance  shows that buyers are strong enough  
12:38
to push into new territory. And the retest of the confluence  
12:42
zone shows that buyers are stepping  in to support price at higher levels. 
12:48
When all these factors align, they provide a  strong signal that market dynamics are changing.  
12:56
Another trade. This chart shows an upward sloping  trendline connecting the lower lows of price  
Detailed Breakdown of a Sell Signal
13:03
action. This trendline represents the overall  bullish sentiment in the market, where buyers have  
13:09
been in control, pushing prices higher over time. The first key event is when price  
13:16
breaks below this upward trendline. This is a significant moment, because  
13:21
it signals that the buying pressure that has  been supporting the uptrend, may be weakening.
13:27
The break of the trendline is the  market's first hint that the balance  
13:31
between buyers and sellers might be shifting. Simultaneously with the trendline break,  
13:37
we're watching a horizontal level that used to act  as support now potentially flipping to resistance. 
13:45
This is a key psychological level for traders. In an uptrend, this level might have been a  
13:51
place where buyers consistently stepped in. Now, if price can't push back above it,  
13:57
it shows that these buyers are  no longer defending this level. 
14:02
The support flipped into resistance. And after the initial break, price often  
14:07
returns to "retest" the broken trendline. It's a moment where the market is deciding  
14:12
if the break was genuine or just a temporary dip. During this retest, the old zones (the trendline  
14:20
and the support level) are  now acting as resistance. 
14:24
If price fails to push back above this confluence  area, it confirms that the previous buyers are no  
14:31
longer strong enough to maintain the uptrend. The power of this sell signal comes from  
14:37
the confluence of both a diagonal and  horizontal resistance, now working together. 
14:44
When price fails to break back above both of these  levels, it's a strong indication that selling  
14:50
pressure is overcoming buying pressure . From a supply and demand viewpoint,  
14:56
this setup makes a lot of sense. During the uptrend, demand  
15:00
consistently outweighed supply at each higher low. The trendline break suggests that this balance is  
15:07
shifting – supply is starting to overcome demand . The retest of the trendline and the old support  
15:14
level is a critical juncture. It's where the remaining  
15:18
demand try to reassert control. If it fails – if price bounces  
15:23
off these levels – it shows that new sellers are  now strong enough to absorb this buying pressure,  
15:30
and push prices lower. This retest trade is all  
The Psychology of a Retest Trade
15:35
you need to trade succesfuly. It’s all about market psychology.  
15:41
During the uptrend, traders got  used to buying at certain levels. 
15:46
When price breaks lower, many don't believe  the move at first. They see the retrace to  
15:52
our confluence area as a chance to buy  again, expecting the uptrend to continue. 
15:58
But if price fails to push higher from  these levels, these buyers are now trapped. 
16:04
Their stop-losses, typically placed  just below their entry points,  
16:08
become fuel for the next move down. As price drops, these stops are hit,  
16:14
creating additional selling pressure. So these trapped Buyers are practically  
16:20
forced to sell, to cut their losses, adding  even more downward pressure to the market.  
16:27
As I said before, you can  confirm your trade using volume. 
Volume and Candlestick Confirmation for a Sell
16:32
Look for higher than average volume  on the initial break of the trendline. 
16:37
This shows strong selling pressure. Then, ideally, you'd see lower  
16:42
volume on the retest. This implies that buyers  
16:45
aren't putting up much of a fight anymore. If you see high volume as price approaches  
16:51
the confluence zone, but fails to break  through, it's an even stronger confirmation. 
16:57
It shows that despite significant buying effort,  sellers were still able to push price back down.  
17:05
Specific candlestick patterns can  add extra confirmation to this sell  
17:09
signal. Look for bearish patterns at the  retest point, such as engulfing patterns,  
17:15
or even just long upper wicks on candles. These patterns show rejection of higher  
17:21
prices and can be the final piece of the  puzzle in confirming the sell signal.  
17:28
Again, this strategy can work on multiple  time frames, but the higher the time frame,  
17:33
generally the more significant the signal. A 4-hour chart showing this pattern might  
17:39
indicate a major trend change, while a 5-minute  chart might signal a shorter-term move.  
Trading the Strategy as a Continuation Pattern
17:47
Now, you might think this  setup anticipates reversals. 
17:51
And it’s true, it can pinpoint  the start of a new trending move. 
17:57
But you can also trade it as a continuation setup. So this chart shows a textbook example of a  
18:04
trend continuation pattern, marking  the end of a complex pullback, and  
18:09
signaling a resumption of the previous uptrend. It all starts with a clear uptrend, starting from  
Analyzing a Complex Pullback in an Uptrend
18:17
the lower left corner. This sets the stage for  our analysis, as we're looking for opportunities  
18:23
to join this existing trend after a pullback. After the initial uptrend, we see a pullback.  
18:31
This isn't a simple, straight-line retracement. Instead, it's a complex pullback, forming  
18:38
a series of lower highs and lower lows. This  complexity often shakes out weak hands and can  
18:45
make traders doubt the original trend. That’s why you’ll see a trend on one  
18:51
time frame, and another one on lower ones. During the pullback, we can draw a descending  
18:57
trendline connecting the lower highs. This trendline acts as dynamic  
19:02
resistance during the pullback phase. At the bottom of the pullback, we see  
19:08
price repeatedly touching a horizontal level. This  level, which initially acted as resistance earlier  
19:15
in the uptrend, now becomes potential support. The first major signal comes when price breaks  
Identifying the Buy Signal in a Continuation
19:23
above the descending trendline.  This break suggests that buyers  
19:27
are starting to overpower sellers . Simultaneously, we see the horizontal level  
19:33
that was previously resistance, now potentially  acting as support. This "flip" will be a powerful  
19:41
indication of a change in market structure. And after breaking this area, price often  
19:47
comes back to "retest" it. This is when we’ll see if  
19:50
we have our confirmation, if the old  resistance will now act as support. 
19:55
It's a key psychological moment  where buyers who missed the initial  
19:59
break get a second chance to enter The buy signal gains strength from the  
20:05
confluence of both the trendline break  and retest, and the support-resistance  
20:09
flip occurring at the same price level. I always look for a momentum confirmation during  
20:15
the retest, not just a simple touch of the zone. Look for a strong bullish candle forming after the  
20:22
retest. This candle confirms that buyers  are indeed stepping in at this level.  
20:29
So while this pattern might look  similar to a reversal setup,  
Continuation Pattern vs. Reversal Setup
20:33
it's actually a continuation pattern. The key difference is the context - we're  
20:38
looking at a pullback in an existing  uptrend, not a reversal of a downtrend. 
20:45
This is important because trading with  the larger trend increases your odds.  
20:51
Complex pullbacks are tricky. They last longer  and have more price swings than simple pullbacks. 
20:58
This complexity often causes  traders to doubt the original trend. 
21:03
Some traders who bought the initial uptrend  might exit their positions during this pullback. 
21:10
Others might even try to short,  thinking a reversal is happening. 
21:15
But when price breaks the trendline  and flips the resistance to support,  
21:20
all these traders are caught on the wrong side. Their scramble to exit losing positions or enter  
21:27
new long positions adds fuel to the next leg up . The combination of breaking a diagonal trendline  
The Power of Combining Diagonal and Horizontal Breaks
21:34
and a horizontal resistance  level is particularly powerful. 
21:39
The diagonal break shows that the rate of  price decline is slowing and reversing. 
21:45
The horizontal break shows  that a significant price level,  
21:49
where sellers were previously in  control, has now been overcome. 
21:54
Together, they signal a significant shift  in the balance between buyers and sellers.  
22:00
If you’re in doubt about  a setup, check the volume! 
22:04
Look for increased volume on the  trendline break and during the retest. 
22:09
High volume on the break  shows strong buying interest. 
22:13
Lower volume on the retest, followed by higher  volume as price moves up, confirms that sellers  
22:20
are exhausted and buyers are taking control. This setup works because it captures a key moment  
22:28
in market dynamics. The complex pullback allows the trend  
22:33
to "digest" its previous gains and transfer  positions from weak hands to strong hands. 
22:40
The trendline break signals  that buyers are returning. 
22:44
The retest and support-resistance flip  confirm that the market structure has changed. 
22:50
Traders who sold during the pullback are now  trapped and need to buy to exit their positions. 
22:57
New buyers see the resumption of the trend  and enter, adding further buying pressure .  
23:04
And of course, not every break leads  to a trend resumption. Sometimes,  
23:09
price will break the confluence zone,  trigger buy orders, and then reverse sharply. 
23:15
This is why waiting for the retest and  the volume confirmation is important. 
23:21
It allows the setup to "prove  itself" before you enter.  
Analyzing a Trend Continuation Sell Setup
23:25
Another trend continuation setup! Price  keeps making lower highs and lower lows. 
23:32
This is our starting point for a sell signal. During this downtrend, price starts to pull back.  
23:38
But it's not a simple, straight-line move up. Instead, we see a complex pullback. The price  
23:45
zigzags, creating a series of higher lows  and higher highs within the larger downtrend. 
23:52
As this pullback unfolds, we can draw an  ascending trendline connecting the lows. 
23:58
This line acts as dynamic support  during the pullback phase. 
24:04
At the same time, we notice a support level where  price has struggled to break through before.  
24:11
After the price breaks below both levels,  we start to prepare. This is our first  
24:16
clue that the pullback might be ending. Our confirmation comes in the form of a  
24:22
retest. Price often climbs back up to touch  or slightly exceed our confluence zone. 
24:29
This is a key moment where sellers who missed  the initial break get a second chance to enter.  
24:36
Again, the sell signal gains strength from  the confluence of both the trendline break,  
24:42
and the support-resistance flip,  occurring at the same price level.  
Differentiating Continuation from Reversal in a Downtrend
24:47
While this pattern might look  like a reversal at first glance,  
24:51
it's actually a continuation pattern. The key is context - we're looking at a  
24:57
pullback in an existing downtrend,  not a reversal of an uptrend. 
25:02
The combination of breaking an ascending trendline  and a horizontal level is particularly powerful. 
25:10
A diagonal break shows that the rate of  price increase is slowing and reversing. 
25:16
The horizontal break shows that a significant  price level, where buyers were previously in  
25:22
control, has now been overcome by sellers. And together, they signal a significant shift  
25:29
in the balance between buyers and sellers. If you see increased volume on the break,  
25:36
even better. High volume on the  
25:38
break means strong selling interest. Lower volume on the retest, maybe  
25:44
followed by higher volume as price moves  down, confirms that buyers are exhausted  
25:50
and sellers are taking control . And from here, it’s simple, you  
25:56
now have a clear level for stop loss placement. You can place it just above the confluence zone. 
26:02
For profit targets, look at  the previous swing lows.  
Application to Other Markets
26:07
And although I trade this setup on gold market,  it has a decent win rate on other ones, especially  
26:13
the crude oil market, and most blue-chip stocks. It works because it captures a key moment in  
26:20
market dynamics, using basic price action. The complex pullback allows the downtrend  
26:27
to "digest" its previous losses and transfer  positions from strong hands to weak hands. 
26:34
The trendline break signals  that sellers are returning. 
26:38
The retest and resistance-support flip  confirm that the market structure has changed. 
26:44
Traders who bought during the pullback are now  trapped and need to sell to exit their positions. 
26:51
New sellers see the resumption of the downtrend  and enter, adding further selling pressure. 
28:57
