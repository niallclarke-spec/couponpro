TASK: Phase 2B — Tenant Isolation (DB filtering + safe writes)

Goal:
Make the app truly multi-tenant by ensuring all tenant-aware data reads/writes are scoped to handler_instance.tenant_id (default entrylab). No tenant can read or modify another tenant’s data.

Scope (must-do):
1) Identify the “key tables” already carrying tenant_id (you previously added tenant_id to: forex_signals, forex_config, telegram_subscriptions, recent_phrases, campaigns, bot_usage, bot_users, broadcast_jobs, bot_config).
2) Update ALL DB helper functions that read lists or single records from these tables to include tenant_id = %s filter.
   - Example: get_all_telegram_subscriptions(), get_forex_signals(), get_campaigns(), revenue metrics helpers, bot_usage queries, etc.
   - For single-record fetches by id, add AND tenant_id = %s.
3) Update ALL insert/update statements for these tables to explicitly set tenant_id (never rely on default) using handler_instance.tenant_id.
4) Do not change EntryLab behavior: when tenant_id resolves to 'entrylab', everything works exactly as before.
5) Add a safety assertion: if a handler is called with tenant_id missing, force it to 'entrylab' (but never allow tenant_id='entrylab' to be overridden by integrations).
6) Add a small verification harness:
   - SQL proof: show a couple of before/after example queries with tenant_id filters.
   - Curl tests: for entrylab admin_session ensure endpoints still return the same results.
   - For a mapped Clerk user tenant (non-entrylab), confirm:
     - Access to EntryLab-only routes remains blocked (existing).
     - Their allowed routes return empty data until that tenant has data.
     - Writes create rows under that tenant_id.

Non-goals (explicitly excluded):
- No new UI work.
- No changes to Clerk JWT verification or tenant mapping endpoint.
- No encryption of tenant_integrations yet.

Deliverables:
- A short list of modified files/functions (DB helpers + handlers).
- Clear logging only where needed (avoid noisy logs).
- Update any tests or add minimal tests if you have an existing tests folder.

Important:
Follow the existing codebase patterns. Use parameterized SQL. Avoid breaking existing EntryLab admin flows.
