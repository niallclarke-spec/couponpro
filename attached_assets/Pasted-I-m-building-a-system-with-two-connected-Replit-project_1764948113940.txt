I’m building a system with two connected Replit projects:

1. EntryLab:
Front-end where users buy subscriptions for my XAU/USD signal service.

2. PromoStack (the backend):
Handles subscription verification, granting/removing access to a private Telegram channel, tracking active users, tracking leads who haven’t converted, and posting AI-generated signals.

I need your help designing a robust framework for PromoStack with the following requirements:

SIGNAL BOT LOGIC

PromoStack must support three signal-generator modes:
	•	Aggressive Bot — generates more signals using looser conditions.
	•	Conservative Bot — fewer signals, stricter conditions.
	•	Custom Bot — I can choose from multiple indicators (MACD, RSI, EMA, ATR, etc.) and create my own rules.

Only one bot can be active at any time.
When a bot is active, it should be the only one generating and sending signals to the Telegram channel.

SIGNAL STORAGE & HISTORY

Every signal generated by any bot must be saved to a storage solution.
I need your recommendation on the best approach: database (Postgres, MongoDB, SQLite), Google Sheets, or another option suitable for Replit.

Each signal should be stored as a row with:
	•	Bot name (Aggressive / Conservative / Custom)
	•	Timestamp
	•	Signal type (Buy/Sell)
	•	Entry price
	•	TP (Take Profit)
	•	SL (Stop Loss)
	•	Current status:
	•	OPEN — still running, hasn’t hit TP or SL yet
	•	WIN — closed with positive pips, include exact pip count
	•	LOSS — closed with negative pips, include exact pip count
	•	Any indicators used (for Custom mode)
	•	Optional notes

ADMIN VIEW

I need an admin table inside PromoStack where I can view:
	•	All pending/open signals
	•	All won signals
	•	All lost signals
Filterable by each bot type (Aggressive / Conservative / Custom).

PERFORMANCE RECAPS

AI should check the stored signal history daily and weekly to:
	•	Calculate wins, losses, net pips
	•	Summarize performance for each bot
	•	Generate recap content
	•	Automatically post this recap to the Telegram channel

WHAT I NEED FROM YOU

Please:
	1.	Recommend the best architecture to build this inside Replit.
	2.	Suggest the ideal way to store the signal history (database vs Google Sheet vs something else).
	3.	Provide a clear technical plan for implementing the three bot modes, active-mode switching, and the signal-tracking system.
	4.	Suggest the simplest and most scalable folder structure + API structure for PromoStack.
